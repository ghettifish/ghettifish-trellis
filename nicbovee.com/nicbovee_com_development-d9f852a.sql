Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https\">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, IÂ also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4588\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:328:\"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

The notice encourages the user to upgrade to PHP 7, explaining that it is faster and more secure. It includes links for getting started and example emails that users can send to their hosting companies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/whip-php-notice.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the 18 days since shipping the plugin with the upgrade nag, Yoast SEO creator Joost de Valk has seen a dramatic uptick in sites moving from old, unsupported versions to PHP 7. From December to March, PHP 5.2 usage among Yoast SEO users decreased from 1.9% to 1.7%, a modest drop over three months. After adding the nag on March 21, PHP 5.2 usage dropped from 1.7% to 1.3% for those using Yoast SEO version 4.5. PHP 5.3 usage is also steadily decreasing since de Valk began the campaign to educate his plugin&#8217;s users about the benefits of upgrading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yoast-stats.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>According to de Valk&#8217;s stats, 22.2% of Yoast SEO users are on version 4.5 of the plugin. He estimates 1,443,000 sites on 4.5 out of 6.5 million users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Assuming 0.5% updated their PHP versions, that&#8217;s 7K sites,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;And another 14-20k that updated from 5.3 to something more decent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many developers are hesitant to implement a nag in their plugins, but Yoast SEO is one of the largest plugins to prove that an ugly, non-dismissible notice can be an effective tool for getting users to take action.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the reasons Iâm sharing is because Iâd love others to join us,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;People don&#8217;t like nags, but we&#8217;ve had some truly great feedback from users who went from PHP 5.2 to 7 and were astonished by how fast their sites suddenly were. Negative feedback has been absolutely minimal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team created a project called WHIP that makes it easy for plugin and theme developers to add notices that will nudge their users to upgrade their software versions, starting with PHP. The project also includes a filter for linking to the WordPress.org recommended hosting page, as an alternative to the Yoast.com hosting overview.</p>\n<p>De Valk said his team intends to push the notice to users on other PHP versions in the near future, starting with 5.3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a release coming next week (4.6), in which we won&#8217;t do it yet,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If all goes well and continues to be mellow, 5.3 will be &#8216;nagged&#8217; as of 4.7, probably three weeks later.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 08 Apr 2017 03:56:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Recommended Reading: Resilient Web Design, a Free e-Book from Jeremy Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/recommended-reading-resilient-web-design-a-free-e-book-from-jeremy-keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5538:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/typewriter.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/4OURRGDU7Z\">Sergey Zolkin</a>\n<p>UK-based web developer <a href=\"https://adactio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Keith</a> published <a href=\"https://resilientwebdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Resilient Web Design</a> as a free e-book in December 2016. Over the past few months, industry leaders have been raving about the book, so I decided to take an evening to find out what all the fuss is about. Keith has been blogging for more than 15 years at <a href=\"http://adactio.com\" target=\"_blank\">adactio.com</a>. He is an active contributor to the web standards movement, a popular conference speaker, and the author of <em>DOM Scripting</em>, <em>Bulletproof Ajax</em>, and <em>HTML5 For Web Designers</em>.</p>\n<p>After just a few pages in, I could see why so many have read Resilient Web Design all in one go. It lives up to all the excellent reviews. The book is divided into seven chapters and can be read in a couple hours. It is not a book on best practices, as one might expect, but rather a historical perspective on web standards and the evolution of responsive design. It provides a foundation for understanding technological progress and is essentially a primer on how breakthrough ideas happen and how resilient ideas endure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The World Wide Web has been around for long enough now that we can begin to evaluate the twists and turns of its evolution,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;I wrote this book to highlight some of the approaches to web design that have proven to be resilient. I didnât do this purely out of historical interest (although I am fascinated by the already rich history of our young industry). In learning from the past, I believe we can better prepare for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith&#8217;s brief history of web design recaptures some of the magic we felt at the dawn of the web. He said much of the subject matter has been included in his conference talks over the past couple of years but the book ended up taking some twists and turns that surprised him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You wonât find any code in here to help you build better websites,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;But you will find ideas and approaches. Ideas are more resilient than code. Iâve tried to combine the most resilient ideas from the history of web design into an approach for building the websites of the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith shares some thought-provoking ideas on design in chapter 3 that are particularly applicable to WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle\" target=\"_blank\">new structure for releases where design and user testing will lead the way</a> in building a new editing and customization experience. The closest thing you can have to predicting the future is an understanding of what has endured in the past and an idea for building on it. Keith&#8217;s book examines principles that have proven to be resilient over time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Design adds clarity,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;Using colour, typography, hierarchy, contrast, and all the other tools at their disposal, designers can take an unordered jumble of information and turn it into something thatâs easy to use and pleasurable to behold. Like life itself, design can win a small victory against the entropy of the universe, creating pockets of order from the raw materials of chaos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keith said he wrote Resilient Web Design for people who create websites in any capacity.

Plugin authors and users <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored#comment-217002\">contend</a> that tabs make information more accessible. The redesign requires visitors to scroll a one-page design and click on various read more links to discover more information.</p>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\">ticket on Trac</a> that suggests a jump section be included so that visitors can jump to specific sections of a plugin&#8217;s readme file. It&#8217;s unclear if this feature will be added but if you&#8217;d like to restore the tabbed layout to the plugin directory, check out <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs\">this Userscript</a> created by Nicolas Jonas.</p>\n<p>According <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO\">to OpenUserJS</a>, userscripts are open source add-ons for browsers that can modify webpages as they&#8217;re loaded. Using userscripts is roughly the same as installing WordPress plugins to restore lost functionality. Jonas&#8217; userscript <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/source\">source code</a> contains a mix of CSS and jQuery to generate the tabs.</p>\n<p>To install the <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">WordPress.org Plugin Directory Tabs</a> userscript in Firefox, you&#8217;ll first need to install the free <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/about/Greasemonkey-for-Firefox\">Greasemonkey extension</a>. Greasemonkey is a Mozilla Add-on for Firefox that allows userscripts to run in the browser.</p>\n<img />Greasemonkey Firefox Add-on\n<p>Jonas developed the userscript in about 30 minutes and used CSS from a CSS button generator. The tabs have a blue background with white text on top. Jonas is open to suggestions and encourages those who want better designed buttons to <a href=\"https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nextgenthemes/Wordpress.org_Plugin_Directory_Tabs/issues\">create an issue</a> with the proper CSS code on his OpenUserJS page.</p>\n<img />Tabbed Layout\n<p>I tested the userscript on Firefox 52.0.2 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. After navigating the plugin directory with tabs, I can easily say I prefer it versus clicking read more links. I rarely have to scroll and the information I want to see is displayed front and center. Simply put, browsing a plugin&#8217;s page with tabs is a better user experience.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 02:25:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Restores Stats and Links to Older Versions of Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-restores-stats-and-links-to-older-versions-of-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1899:\"<p>Since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\">launch</a> of the newly redesigned WordPress plugin directory, the Meta team has been hard at work fixing bugs and updating the design.

That&#8217;s what <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B01N1O4M4G\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Helper</a>, an Alexa skill, enables for WordPress.com and self-hosted Jetpack users. It is available for free in Amazon&#8217;s catalog of Alexa skills.</p>\n<p>Automattic developer <a href=\"https://www.chrisfinke.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Finke</a> created the Alexa integration for WordPress after purchasing an Echo and some Dots for his house and experimenting with different ways for making them useful. He programmed Blog Helper to allow users to check WordPress.com notifications, moderate pending comments, and save blog post ideas as drafts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-27-at-10.17.11-PM-e1490671125329.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Blog Helper relies on WordPress.com&#8217;s OAuth support, which Finke said self-hosted sites can get via Jetpack. After asking Alexa to enable Blog Helper, you will need to link your WordPress.com account and select the blog you want to access. Once you&#8217;re hooked up, you can say, &#8220;Alexa, ask Blog Helper for my notifications.&#8221; Alexa will read off new notifications one-by-one and mark them as read.</p>\n<p>Blog Helper also enables comment moderation with your voice, so you can take care of that while folding the laundry or doing dishes. If you ask, &#8220;Do I have any comments to moderate?&#8221;, Alexa will read them to you and you can approve, delete, or mark them as spam. Check out the quick demo video Finke created to hear it in action:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>Scientific studies have proven that <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/why-great-ideas-always-come-in-the-shower-and-how-to-h-1617303016\" target=\"_blank\">some of your best ideas come to you when your mind is relaxed and your body is distracted by routine tasks</a>. If you have an Alexa-enabled device, Blog Helper is a fun way to help you capture your creative ideas in WordPress before they get away. It allows you to create new drafts without having to pick up your phone or sit down to your desktop.</p>\n<p>Although Finke works for Automattic, he wrote Blog Helper in his free time and it doesn&#8217;t have any official affiliation with WordPress.com. His said his roadmap is to try and make as much of the core WordPress experience accessible by voice as possible. Blog Helper can be a big time-saver for those who want to manage their blogs without being tied down to a screen, but the voice interface can also be useful for those who have vision impairments.

The new settings screen has been completely rearranged under a more simplified menu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We went through every setting on WordPress.com and Jetpack to make sure it was necessary to keep around, and to find a good, logical home for each one,&#8221; Jetpack designer Michael Arestad said. &#8220;We ended up mirroring the WordPress core settings groups for now â they are familiar to people, and things fit well there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arestad said he was inspired by the way mobile devices handle settings, especially how they rarely include a &#8220;Save&#8221; button unless it&#8217;s an option that isn&#8217;t a simple toggle. The Jetpack design team applied this to the settings screens so that most of them are now autosaved.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/autosave.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also introduces the ability to enable the WordPress.com Toolbar, a new feature that replaces the wp-admin toolbar with the My Sites menu, a link to the WordPress.com reader, a Write button that takes you to WordPress.com, and a notifications dropdown. It is essentially the same toolbar you see when working with a WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/jetpack-wp-com-toolbar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 includes several dozen improvements and bug fixes. A few of the highlights include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New MailChimp Subscribe Popup widget</li>\n<li>Sitemaps are faster and now support sites with a very large number of posts (1,000+)</li>\n<li>Contact Form now has a plain-text alternative and better avoids spam filters</li>\n<li>Debug form includes extra information to better prioritize support requests</li>\n<li>Photon can now be used within the dashboard and supports bbPress topics and replies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Jetpack 4.8.1 Fixes PHP Incompatibility Issue</h3>\n<p>Many users reported fatal errors and blank pages after updating to Jetpack 4.8. A temporary fix was to load an older version of Jetpack. In a convenient turn of events, the WordPress plugin directory restored the ability to download older versions of plugins today (found under the new Advanced View link).</p>\n<p>Jetpack 4.8 included PHP code that is incompatible with PHP versions lower than 5.4, which caused the fatal errors. The Sitemaps module also included an incompatibility with the WP Rocket plugin. Additionally, the release included many new translation files, which caused updates not to complete on sites that have limited resources for processing large files on updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/04/05/jetpack-4-8-1-php-version-incompatibility-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 4.8.1</a> was released a few hours ago to correct these issues. The Jetpack development team recommends manually installing the plugin via FTP/SFTP if your site crashed and you are unable to update through the admin.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 21:07:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"HeroPress: WordPress Flexibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1680\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5214:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.\" /><p>When I was asked to describe myself and my interests for a bio at work I floundered. I felt the same way when sitting down to write this. Where do I even begin? For my bio, I decided instead of narrowing it down Iâd go with âjill-of-all-trades.â I really like to do everything and if I donât like something I only know that because I tried it first. Iâve been this way since I can remember. At school I got good grades in everything (except Chemistry), I liked everything (except Chemistry) and I wanted to do everything. Figuring out my career path was therefore a long process (I actually started out pre-med in college, but you know&#8230; Chemistry).</p>\n<p>After graduating college I started working in marketing and absolutely hated it &#8211; I did the same exact thing almost every day. It was miserable. I missed the old web content job I had during college, where I did SEO, product photography, email campaigns, basically anything website related. Right now I canât believe there was a point in my life that I missed HTML emails, but I did. I missed the flexibility, doing something different every day, and most importantly, I missed the creative problem solving it entailed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I quit my stupid marketing job and attended a coding bootcamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a Front End Development track where I honed my HTML and CSS skills, learned JavaScript in a few forms (vanilla, jQuery, AngularJS), and learned other tools of the trade (git, task runners, bash, etc.). When I landed my first web development job I was excited &#8211; the company did all sorts of different projects: web apps, web sites, intranets, you name it. I knew that there was enough variety to keep me constantly moving and constantly learning. My first project was something I was familiar with, an AngularJS application, but my second project was something Iâd never seen before &#8211; a WordPress site. Knowing zero PHP, I dove right in.</p>\n<p>I canât say that I loved WordPress right off the bat. When I was still mostly developing pretty simple sites with it, I was afraid it was going to become monotonous. Today I know how wrong I was. Although the majority of the projects I work with involve WordPress, I can do something new and different with every site.</p>\n<p>Just this year Iâve worked on a WordPress theme with a headless React front end, a WordPress site with part of the admin area written in React, and a WordPress plugin with a front end built in Angular 2. Even traditional WordPress themes can be exciting. Each client has their own needs and with the flexibility of templates, post types, and widgets every site I build is a new challenge.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Iâve come a long way since drowning in monotony early in my career.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At home you might find me doing yard work, refinishing furniture, knitting, wood burning, or attempting to play the banjo. But at work, using WordPress gives me all the flexibility I need to be constantly learning and improving.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%20Flexibility&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: WordPress Flexibility\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-flexibility%2F&title=WordPress+Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/040517-min-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress Flexibility\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\" title=\"WordPress Flexibility\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-flexibility/\">WordPress Flexibility</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 12:00:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Natalie Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.0 Brings Major Improvements to Product Gallery, Introduces CRUD Classes and a New CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68232\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4330:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/04/woocommerce-3-0-release/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.0</a> âBionic Butterflyâ was released today with significant improvements to the product gallery and developer tools. This version, which was previously going to be <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/important-update-regarding-the-upcoming-woocommerce-release-2-7-will-be-3-0-0/\" target=\"_blank\">2.7</a>, is the first major release since the plugin <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-0-scheduled-for-release-april-4th\" target=\"_blank\">switched to semantic versioning</a>. It was released after more than three months in beta and an extended RC testing period that allowed extension and theme developers enough time to get up to speed.</p>\n<p>The new product gallery has subtle improvements for galleries with multiple images. Clicking on a thumbnail updates the image without forcing it to open in a popup window. Galleries in 3.0 are also more intuitive on mobile with support for touch gestures, including swipe to scroll through the gallery, pinch to zoom, and swipe up to close the current image. These and several bug fixes and improvements deliver a much smoother experience of viewing product images.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-wrap\"></div>\n<p>This release includes significant performance improvements, thanks to the switch from post meta to taxonomies for features like product visibility, featured products, and out of stock products. WooCommerce contributors have also reduced the number of queries required to display related products and upsells.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/the-new-crud-classes-in-woocommerce-2-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.0 introduces CRUD</a> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) classes for developers, making it easier to write and retrieve data from the database with less code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;High order volume is one of the best problems a store can have, but it can really slow down your siteâs performance,&#8221; WooCommerce lead developer Mike Jolley said. &#8220;Thatâs why our teamâs main focus this year is performance and scalability.&#8221; Scalability improvements are planned for the next several releases.</p>\n<p>Version 3.0 also <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/12/12/2-7-a-new-cli-for-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">introduces a new command line interface (CLI)</a> powered by the REST API. The previous CLI didn&#8217;t fully support the same functionality and was powered by its own separate code. The new CLI forks <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/restful\" target=\"_blank\">Restful</a> to make REST API endpoints available as WP-CLI commands. It reduces the amount of code that WooCommerce has to maintain and ensures that the commands are always current as the project&#8217;s REST API is updated in the future.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce support forums on WordPress.org</a> have been lighting up with requests after 3.0 was released. One particular issue pinned to the top of the forums is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-error-option-ajax-is-not-allowed-for-select2/\" target=\"_blank\">an incompatibility with Select2 v3</a>. The latest version of WooCommerce uses Select2 V4 and this may cause an issue with AJAX search inputs in plugins and themes loading an older version of Select2.</p>\n<p>Another issue users are having after upgrade is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/3-0-frontend-pages-refreshing/\" target=\"_blank\">frontend pages reloading endlessly</a>, which WooCommerce developers have identified as a problem with the geolocation setting. They are working on a fix for 3.0.1.</p>\n<p>Many users who are reporting issues after updating to 3.0 have discovered incompatibilities with themes or plugins. This release received more than 3,000 commits from 115 contributors. With this many changes packed into a major release, WooCommerce developers recommend testing on a staging site and making a backup before updating the plugin. This will give you the opportunity to make sure your theme and plugins are compatible with the update.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Apr 2017 01:56:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Disconnect From Technology at Camp Press September 23-24 in Seminole, OK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/disconnect-from-technology-at-camp-press-september-23-24-in-seminole-ok\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4477:\"<p>Readers may remember in 2015, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/camppress-a-2-3-day-social-experience-for-geeks-and-creatives\">we highlighted</a>Â Camp Press, a conference devoted to disconnectingÂ fromÂ technology to focus on strengthening bonds that encourage collaboration within the community.</p>\n<p>Mendel Kurland, who has spent the better part of two years organizing the event, <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">announced</a> that Camp Press will take place September 23-24, at Fry LakeÂ in Seminole, OK.

The guidelines state that sponsors may not wear branded gear and that advertising must be hand-made on-site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We realize these guidelines arenât for everyone, but weâre looking for creativity rather than corporate branding for these sponsorships,&#8221; Kurland said.</p>\n<p>Sponsorship levels range from $1,500 to $3,000 and offer various perks.</p>\n<p>Those interested in attending are encouraged to review the event&#8217;s <a href=\"https://camp.press/code-of-conduct/\">Code of Conduct,</a> which is unique compared to an event held in a physical building. For example,Â it has aÂ guideline forÂ leaving no trace:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be involved with WordPress to attendÂ the event.Â For more information and to purchase tickets, visit the <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">official Camp Press site</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 20:32:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WPTavern: WP-CLI Names Alain Schlesser New Co-Maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68228\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-names-alain-schlesser-new-co-maintainer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5640:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wp-cli.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WP-CLI has hired <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alain Schlesser</a> as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/04/03/new-co-maintainer-alain-thanks-2017-sponsors/\" target=\"_blank\">new part-time co-maintainer</a>. The position was made possible by sponsorships from Automattic, Bluehost, DreamHost, SiteGround, WP Engine, and more than 60 individuals who contributed to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Alain joining the project as a co-maintainer, the WP-CLI project is restoring capacity to meet current demands (e.g. support), and ramping up on new feature development and evangelization,&#8221; WP-CLI co-maintainer Daniel Bachhuber said. &#8220;Weâve already improved the build time by 33%!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser first became involved in the project after Bachhuber contacted him last March for input on solving some outstanding issues with Composer, which WP-CLI uses for external package management. Schlesser said he couldn&#8217;t afford the time to actively work on the issue at that time but tried to offer meaningful input for the right angle for solving the remaining issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This short collaboration changed my perception about WP-CLI and helped me realize that there is a push to use modern and modular code to improve the tool and prepare it for future requirements,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, already at that point, I wanted to contribute to the project. However, I was already involved in a different part of WordPress contribution (which is now the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/22/nextgen-bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">Nextgen Bootstrap/Load Feature Project</a>), and I had to prioritize my volunteer work and keep a few hours left for paid client work as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser said taking on the role of a maintainer became an option once it was a paid position made possible by the project&#8217;s 2017 sponsors. Prior to that he would not have been able to financially afford the additional time investment that WP-CLI requires. The new role enables him to work for 5-10 hours per week on general user support, development of new and improved features, writing documentation, managing the issue backlog, reviewing pull requests and working on the project&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In joining WP-CLI as a co-maintainer, Schlesser brings a fresh perspective from developing for other platforms and years experience managing and contributing to <a href=\"https://www.alainschlesser.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of open source projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP-CLI is in a unique place in terms of what it tries to achieve and how it does it (out of necessity),&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;For most other web platforms, the command line interface is a regular part of the core of the system itself, often building what is known as a <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Hexagonal Architecture</a>. WP-CLI, on the other hand, achieves most of the same benefits even though it has no direct control over the Core source code, and that source code is not meant to support such an architecture. Given the obstacles, the current results are quite an achievement!&#8221;</p>\n<p>After its 1.0.0 release, WP-CLI <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-cli-1-1-0-released-project-shifts-to-expand-package-index\" target=\"_blank\">shifted to focus on its package ecosystem</a>. New features are now built as standalone packages instead of rolling everything into WP-CLI core. The eventual goal is to better distribute the project&#8217;s maintenance burden among package maintainers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the most important change in the upcoming release is that all the bundled commands have been extracted into separate packages, and we&#8217;re currently in the process of getting rid of all the issues that this move has uncovered,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;So, when it comes to making WP-CLI easily extensible and improving the tools and interfaces, we&#8217;re now eating our own dog food. In the longer term, I expect this change to have a significant impact on the onboarding experience for developers who want to create their own commands.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During his years contributing to open source projects, Schlesser said he has become well-acquainted with the unique challenges and emotional toll of maintainership, a topic that <a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/2016/06/26/my-condolences-youre-now-the-maintainer-of-a-popular-open-source-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Bachhuber has spoken about in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maintenance of a popular open source project is at the intersection of the hard logic of technology and deeply human group dynamics,&#8221; Schlesser said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve become more aware of all the difficulties that come with such a role, but I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily state that I know anything more now on how to navigate around them. What I know for sure is that it is a burden that should be shared amongst several people when at all possible. It comes with constant pressure and churn, and doing this work as a single person puts both the project and the person at risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schlesser plans to keep an eye out for any avoidable friction points in hopes of making the experience of maintainership as smooth as possible for all involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Daniel has already done a great job with this, and I can&#8217;t wait to see where the project will take us as a team,&#8221; Schlesser said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Apr 2017 17:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"BuddyPress: 2016 BuddyPress Survey Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=265117\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/04/2016-buddypress-survey-results/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18896:\"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-265189\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2017/04/bp-countries-2016.png\" alt=\"61 country flags of survey participants\" width=\"765\" height=\"490\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thank you!</h2>\n<p>This report presents the results from the 2016 BuddyPress Survey held from November 1 through December 31, 2016. Three hundred and two (302) respondents from 61 countries completed the survey and provided valuable and interesting feedback. Many thanks!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Survey Design/Method</h2>\n<p>The survey contained 36 questions geared towards <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/priorities-for-the-next-12-months/\">Site Builders and WordPress Developers</a>. Adjusting to this more focused target audience compared to previous years&#8217;, I selected some questions from our BuddyPress <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2013/09/2013-buddypress-codex-survey-results/\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/\">2014</a> and <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2015/05/2015-buddypress-survey-results/\">2015</a> Surveys, combined/split/modified some of the questions, and added 15 new questions. The survey was designed to maximize responses and get snapshots of:<br />\n&#8211; basic demographic information<br />\n&#8211; versions of WordPress, BuddyPress, bbPress, and PHP used<br />\n&#8211; the types, languages, number of members in BP sites<br />\n&#8211; comfort levels with BuddyPress, BP theme compatibility, and BP Hooks<br />\n&#8211; development practices and tools<br />\n&#8211; respondents willing to share their BP use cases<br />\n&#8211; BuddyPress participation and contributions<br />\n&#8211; comments about BuddyPress, BP theme/plugin development, and the survey.</p>\n<p>The questionnaire was finalized after incorporating the feedback on the draft from the BP Lead/Core Developers last year. The survey was then promoted via Twitter, BP support forums, bpdevel.wordpress.com, and survey banners added by <a class=\"bp-suggestions-mention\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/johnjamesjacoby/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@johnjamesjacoby</a> at https://buddypress.org and https://codex.buddypress.org which helped a lot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>This section shows some of the highlights from the survey with short comments about each. All supporting graphs, tables, and user comments from this survey are available in the accessible and mobile-friendly webpage.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>A. What&#8217;s New</h3>\n<h4>1.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">sold its ten millionth Pi</a> last year and just released the Pi Zero W in February 2017 with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>If you are among the millions of Raspberry Pi owners who like to tinker with software, check out Automattic&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> project. It currently offers the easiest way of installing WordPress onto a Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p>Although RaspberryPi.org has documentation for <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">how to run WordPress as a local website on your Raspberry Pi</a>, its recommended method requires you to install and configure Apache, PHP, and MySQL to create a LAMP web server.</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box makes it simpler with a GUI <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a> that puts everything you need for installing WordPress onto an SD card. It comes bundled with PHP7, Nginx, and the latest version of WordPress. It automatically installs the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Blog In A Box WordPress plugin</a>, which provides an interface for the Blog In A Box CLI tool and widgets for SenseHAT readings. It also includes a full Node development environment. The project&#8217;s creators call it &#8220;a complete system for interfacing Pi hardware with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blog in a Box enables users to publish data captured by the Raspberry Pi camera and SenseHAT, like photos or temperature readings, to a WordPress site that can be accessed on your local network at bloginabox.local. It is not yet capable of publishing to the web, but John Godley, an Automattic developer who worked on the project, said the team is open to adding this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the fun of a Pi is having this device in front of you that you can play and experiment with, and we wanted to have WordPress running right there inside the Pi too &#8211; it really is a blog in a box!&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope that having it local will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and use it to learn programming, or to run experiments in classrooms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are currently no live examples of blogs on the web that are receiving posts from a Raspberry Pi. However, fellow Automattic developer and Pi enthusiast Nick Momrik has created a device called <a href=\"https://nick.blog/2017/03/14/blog-in-a-box-paparazzi/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi</a> that extends the project with additional sensors to take a photo when anyone walks past it. His circuit diagram and a full list of sensors and other electronic components are available on <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s one example of how Blog in a Box can be used as a base for other fun use cases.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paparazzi-fritzing.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Nick Momrik &#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/nickmomrik/biab-paparazzi\">Blog in a Box Paparazzi GitHub repo</a>\n<p>Although the project doesn&#8217;t come packaged with functionality that would allow it to work as a livecam, Godley said it&#8217;s certainly a possibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a system to make it easy to interface the Pi hardware with WordPress &#8211; there&#8217;s a plugin and a set of server tools that are all extensible,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;With a bit of work a livecam system could be added. If you add the sensor mentioned above you could livestream your cat whenever itâs nearby. Add some different sensors and you can see what affects a plantâs growth in a biology experiment and have the data ready to be viewed through WordPress, add a touchscreen and you have an interactive WordPress-powered display.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since the system uses the REST API internally, Godley it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to configure it to send data to a remote WordPress site. The team has looked at the possibility of doing this and may revisit it in the future if there&#8217;s enough interest.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it really easy to set up was a primary aim &#8211; we didnât want people to have to setup MySQL and web servers and all the complexities involved in connecting this to Pi sensors. Just a few clicks and a fully working system is copied to an SD card,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;Once you boot your Pi it appears on your local network and can be used immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The site runs on the local network but the box ensures that WordPress and its plugins stay updated. The ability to run the box without an internet connection is one of the main advantages of Blog in a Box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact you can run it without an internet connection means it can be used in situations where a remote WordPress may not be appropriate &#8212; in your home, in schools, etc,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;If someone <a href=\"https://astro-pi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">sends WordPress into space on a rocket</a>, then weâd love to hear about it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project is an exciting example of how WordPress can be deeply integrated with various hardware components to automatically capture and publish environmental data in a way that&#8217;s easy to view. Godley and his team at Automattic hope that <a href=\"https://inabox.blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog in a Box</a> will put WordPress into the hands of more like-minded tinkerers. The entire project, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-installer\" target=\"_blank\">installer</a>, the companion WordPress <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-theme\" target=\"_blank\">theme</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/biab-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a>, are all open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As well as people connecting the real world to their Pi, we hope that just having a full web development environment ready to go will encourage people to tinker with WordPress and try out programming or theming,&#8221; Godley said.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Apr 2017 21:34:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"HeroPress: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=1675\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3588:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"444\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heropress_middle_east-min-1024x474.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"HeroPress pins on a google map in the Middle East\" /><p>For a while now I&#8217;ve been thinking about how to best leverage older content on HeroPress.

This week I chose the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-to-become-a-reputable-wordpress-developer-on-your-own/\">How to Become a Reputable WordPress Developer, on Your Own!</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-through-wordpress/\">Growing Through WordPress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/ambition-persistence-self-motivation/\">Ambition, Persistence, and Self-Motivation</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blogging-solopreneurship-terrorism/\">Blogging, Solopreneurship, &#038; Terrorism</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=HeroPress%20Geography%3A%20The%20Middle%20East&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fheropress-geography-middle-east%2F&title=HeroPress+Geography%3A+The+Middle+East\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heropress_middle_east-min-150x150.png&description=HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\" title=\"HeroPress Geography: The Middle East\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-geography-middle-east/\">HeroPress Geography: The Middle East</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Apr 2017 13:42:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Support Shuts Down WordCamp Netherlands in Favor of City-Based WordCamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-support-shuts-down-wordcamp-netherlands-in-favor-of-city-based-wordcamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10904:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordcamp-netherlands.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The application for WordCamp Netherlands 2017 has been denied. The camp, which held its sixth edition in Utrecht last year with more than 425 attendees, was one of the most well-established WordPress events in Europe. Yesterday lead organizer Marcel Bootsman published a <a href=\"https://nl.wordpress.org/team/2017/03/30/het-einde-van-wordcamp-the-netherlands/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Dutch WordPress community site to explain why the camp has been cancelled.</p>\n<p>Bootsman&#8217;s post is written in Dutch but includes correspondence in English between the WCNL team and WordPress Community Support (WCS), formerly WordCamp Central. WCS is now pushing for all WordCamps to be city-based with the exception of regional camps, such as WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe, where the cities already have their own camps and do not prevent or detract from local communities launching their own camps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands has been held 6 times to date and&#8230;It has not inspired any local WordCamps (in fact, I think itâs probably fair to say that local camps have not been happening because people donât see a need for them with the country-wide camp happening each year) and, with the exception of Nijmegen, which is still in the pre-planning phase, no cities in the Netherlands have their own WordCamps,&#8221; a WCS representative said. &#8220;With that in mind, we feel that the time has come for your community to move from the country-wide camp to running local camps. This has started happening with Nijmegen already and can easily start happening more with WordCamps in Utrecht, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other cities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Netherlands is <a href=\"http://mapfight.appspot.com/nl-vs-us.md/netherlands-maryland-us-size-comparison\" target=\"_blank\">roughly the size of Maryland</a>, or twice the size of New Jersey, in terms of land space. One can drive across the country in two hours or less. The WCNL team contends that a country-wide WordCamp makes sense for geographical reasons and because of the locations of the organizers. The country already has an active meetup culture with 13 different meetups hosting an average of 100 attendees per event. Organizers do not see the need to have multiple smaller WordCamps fill the role that the local meetups are already doing.</p>\n<p>In response to the reasons WCNL organizers&#8217; outlined for not shutting down their event, the WCS representative replied, &#8220;I donât think thereâs really any benefit to responding to all of your points in the last email individually.&#8221; WCS reiterated its decision regarding the camp:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will not be approving WordCamp The Netherlands 2017. We would like to see city-based WordCamps happening around the Netherlands â Nijmegen being a great start to that process.</p>\n<p>Weâre confident that with the space that WCNL filled being vacated, we will see some of the meetup organizers around the country stepping up to fill that space for their local communities. The local city camps may be smaller, but in many ways that can be a much better than a single large camp.</p>\n<p>As I said before, we would be happy to look at doing WCNL again in a couple of years time once there are a few city-based camps around the country happening regularly. In that case, however, WCNL would be there to complement, and not replace, the city-based camps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Netherlands was the last remaining exception to this new rule that drops country-wide WordCamps in favor of city-based camps. The Dutch community and many of its supporters are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roytanck/status/847365810506969089\" target=\"_blank\">now</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrf_nl/status/847470162496241664\" target=\"_blank\">in</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nielsvr/status/847384382541148161\" target=\"_blank\">an</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mchaste/status/847374014414704645\" target=\"_blank\">uproar</a> over the decision and organizers are at a crossroads. They can choose to rebrand the event as WordCamp Utrecht, with significant drawbacks, or move forward with an independent country-wide event without the use of WordCamp tools, branding and trademarks, or funding from the Global Community Sponsorship Program.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Conflict Highlights Cultural Differences Between the U.S. and Europe</h3>\n<p>Marcel Bootsman, who heads up the 13-person WordCamp Netherlands organization team, said they have been working since late December 2016 on the upcoming event. The team had added eight new members after the event grew 68% from 2015 to 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody was thrilled to start, and the news that we could not continue hit us hard,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We have officially stopped and I have thanked everyone for their enthusiasm and support, which was difficult because I wanted to let these people feel what it is to organize an event and see happy faces all over the place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress developer and Dutch community member Juliette Reinders Folmer said she doesn&#8217;t believe that more than one or perhaps two city-based WordCamps will get started in the Netherlands. Organizing a WordCamp is not an easy endeavor with a small pool of local organizers and volunteers. Folmer notes that since the WordPress Foundation doesn&#8217;t allow for compensating speakers for their out-of-pocket costs, the speaker pool is further limited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A trend I&#8217;ve spotted over the last few years is that &#8216;local&#8217; WCs will have a mix of local, national and international speakers,&#8221; Folmer said. &#8220;While national speakers might still be prepared to go out of pocket, the only international speakers who can afford to do this are the ones who are sponsored by big companies which pay their travel and time to speak at those WCs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of creating a larger speaker group with new and interesting voices, we&#8217;re ending up with a corporate uniform message where the more innovative and sometimes dissident voices are few and far between. By forcing WCNL to break up into smaller more local groups, this trend will become even more persistent and insidious as the demands on the limited group of national speakers will increase unless they have corporate sponsoring. Even they will not able to afford the time and costs to attend and speak at the various local WCs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Remkus de Vries, WordCamp Netherlands lead-organizer from 2009 to 2015, said the team has worked for years to see the local communities come together, and have seen people get involved with translations, forum moderation, and local meetups after attending the WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our idea from the get go for WordCamp Netherlands was to be as inclusive as possible, to unite the scattered Dutch WordPress community,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;The Dutch community consisted of little islands that didn&#8217;t really connect at all. We&#8217;ve been working very hard to unite our Dutch Community via WordCamp Netherlands and it was working perfectly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of our inclusive approach we started getting international visitors and speakers from the early start as well, but more importantly, the event, as a national event, pulled everyone in from all corners of the Netherlands. Our community started and flourished because we started as a central entity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bootsman is not optimistic about the future of the Dutch WordPress community after receiving the decision from WCS. The conflict has highlighted a key difference between U.S. and European cultures when it comes to traveling. Whereas Americans might think a 4-5 hour drive to another city is a short road trip, Europe&#8217;s population is much more dense than the U.S. and traveling several hours to another city is not common.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When there is no WordCamp Netherlands, my personal belief is that this will break up the community,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;Of course we will have central tools like Slack, nl.w.org and other ways to communicate, but that is nothing compared to an event where all these people can meet. People are busy and can&#8217;t find time to visit multiple WordCamps in the Netherlands. Distances are not that large in NL, that is not an issue, but time is. When you have a central WordCamp The Netherlands once a year you plan, so you are available to go. In the new situation, when there is a WordCamp Rotterdam, why visit a WordCamp in another town? This maybe hard to understand, but this is how it works for Dutch people. We&#8217;re too practical sometimes, and in this situation, it will not help the community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Netherlands Organizers are Considering Hosting an Independent Event</h3>\n<p>Both de Vries and Bootsman are said they do not believe rules that make sense for the U.S. should be applied universally. They would prefer them to be guidelines that communities can follow or depart from if they express their preference for a country-wide WordCamp. WordPress communities in other countries like Denmark, Croatia, and Switzerland have expressed similar frustrations with the U.S.-centric rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Netherlands was what started the local WordPress meetups and ended up being the glue between the WordPress Meetups,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;Forcing us to stop using WordCamp Netherlands is going to impact that as you could see by the outpouring of reactions yesterday on Twitter and Facebook. Renaming WordCamp Netherlands to WordCamp Utrecht, as suggested by many, could be a solution, but nobody of the organizing team lives in the city which means, per the WCS rules, we can&#8217;t do that. But more importantly, we would be losing &#8216;our glue.&#8217; We feel that our efforts of the last years have just been flushed down the toilet with this &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WCNL organizers were told in no uncertain terms that their camp is cancelled, a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/30/wordcamp-netherlands-today-the/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Community team blog indicates that representatives are considering feedback on the decision.</p>\n<p>The first two WordCamp Netherlands were not under the umbrella of WordCamp Central, and de Vries said they will find a way to have the camp if it comes to that. Organizers are currently examining their options.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is too soon to announce things about this but let me say that we feel the Netherlands needs to have a countrywide WordPress event based on the experiences of the last years,&#8221; Bootsman said. &#8220;We are not going to let the Netherlands WordPress community down.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 23:39:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Redesign: Why So Many People Feel Their Feedback Was Ignored\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68135\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-redesign-why-so-many-people-feel-their-feedback-was-ignored\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15523:\"<p>Earlier this week, the WordPress plugin directory <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\">relaunched</a> with a new design and an improved search algorithm. Feedback has been rolling in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comments\">from Tavern readers</a> and members of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1446257985436411/?match=cGx1Z2luKyBkaXJlY3RvcnkscGx1Z2luIGRpcmVjdG9yeSxwbHVnaW5z\">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a>.</p>\n<p>The improvements to search has received a number of positive comments in addition to people requesting the ability <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comment-216693\">to sort results</a>. The responsive design and aesthetics of the page have also received praise.</p>\n<p>There are a number of items that plugin developers and users have reported as downsides to the new design. Some of the most notable include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin stats are only available to the plugin author by logging into the admin.</li>\n<li>Tabbed layout was replaced with a series of Read more links.</li>\n<li>Plugin banner images are distorted.</li>\n<li>The Installation tab which provided instructions on how to install the plugin is gone.</li>\n<li>Screenshots do not open in a lightbox, but open on a new page instead.</li>\n<li>Links to download older versions of plugins is missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of the issues reported above are known and have been known for months. While it may seem like a lot of people are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm#comment-216738\">suddenly complaining</a> and didn&#8217;t participate in the feedback loop, it&#8217;s important to look back to see how the plugin directory redesign reached this point.</p>\n<h2>From Prototypes to Open Beta</h2>\n<p>In May 2016, the WordPress Meta team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meta-team-publishes-prototypes-of-the-plugin-directory-redesign\">published prototypes</a> of a new design for the WordPress plugin directory. The announcement generated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/\">abundant feedback</a> with a strong push towards adding data instead of removing it.</p>\n<p>Many users <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8151\">reported</a> that moving the plugin author, last updated, and active install information from the plugin&#8217;s listing page to the plugin&#8217;s details page was a downside. Samuel Sidler, Apollo Team Lead at Automattic, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/05/19/plugin-directory-prototypes/#comment-8154\">responded</a> to the feedback explaining why he didn&#8217;t think showing the information to users was useful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Author, as you said, is only really useful for insiders. The latter two, meanwhile, are already taken into account in the search results. If a plugin doesnât have a recent compatible version, it will move down the list. If itâs too old, it wonât get shown at all (which is the case today).</p>\n<p>Active installs is more interesting, but we account for it weighting search results as-is. I actually find it refreshing to <em>not</em> show the active installs as it allows for less-popular plugins to get more downloads. Users will be less likely to click the popular plugins (outside of familiar names) and more likely to find the plugin they actually need.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There was also a lot of discussion on how to improve and display search results.</p>\n<p>In June 2016, at WordCamp Europe, Konstantin Obenland, WordPress core contributor, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-directory-now-in-open-beta\">announced</a> that the WordPress plugin directory redesign was in open beta. The team received feedback from Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress project, on changing the direction and design of the page. âWeâre really just at the beginning of design iterations,â Obenland said. âHe thinks we can do better, which heâs right about. We can and we should.â</p>\n<p>Kevan <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-directory-now-in-open-beta#comment-185077\">commented on the open beta</a> and pointed out many of the same issues that were reported with the prototypes. In July 2016, Obenland <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/\">announced</a> version three of the open beta. The use of Read more links in favor of the tabbed interface was again <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8400\">brought up</a> in the comments by John Blackbourn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Iâm really concerned about the liberal use of &#8216;Read more&#8217; links on individual plugin pages,&#8221; Blackbourn said. &#8220;Theyâre being used in order to fix the information overload problem caused by placing all the information onto one page, instead of using the tabbed interface of the current directory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to Blackbourn, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8413\">Joy stated</a> that the issue of Read more links had already been discussed and that the feedback was ignored. The feeling of being ignored was also shared <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8476\">by Jon Brown</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Itâs hard to see feedback has been heard and in this case a lot of it doesnât seem to have been taken into account (bring back tabs, no read moreâ¦).&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I donât see everything, or even much, so I could have certainly missed it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mika Epstein <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/07/12/plugin-directory-v3-open-beta/#comment-8418\">responded</a> that the feedback was not ignored and that Obenland was in the process of collecting and collating information.</p>\n<p>Four months ago, Kenshino <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2328\">created a ticket</a> on WordPress Meta that outlined usability concerns with using Read more links instead of tabs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Clicking on <span class=\"searchword0\">Read</span> <span class=\"searchword1\">more</span> &#8211; say on the change log requires me to scroll to the bottom before I&#8217;m able to reach the next section,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Essentially for me to go through all the sections, provided that they are long enough, I&#8217;d have to click, scroll a few pages, click, scroll a few pages etc until I get through all the sections.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The ticket was closed as a duplicate of <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2278\">Greg Ross&#8217; ticket</a>. In it, he suggests a Jump section be added so users can navigate to specific sections of the Read Me without having to scroll through the entire page. The ticket has received minor support and recently had its milestone changed from version three to a future version.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Contributors Feel Ignored</h2>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490824833904957\">meeting held earlier this week</a> in the WordPress Meta Slack channel, Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at WordImpress, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490825538070889\">suggested</a> that the Meta team describe the process of collecting and acting on feedback in as much detail as possible in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/03/30/announcing-the-new-wordpress-plugin-directory/\">announcement post</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve chatted with a lot of developers and many feel like they provided actionable feedback about the direction of the plugin directory and all advice was ignored,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Whether or not that&#8217;s an accurate assessment, it&#8217;s a real feeling that is shared by many. I&#8217;ve been here most weeks and know well that feedback was received and acted on, but there&#8217;s still a strong perception.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the concerns of using Read more links brought up during every phase of the project, they don&#8217;t appear to have been addressed. Other gripes expressed by members of the community at the outset of the redesign have largely remained. It&#8217;s no wonder that so many people feel like they&#8217;ve been ignored.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826336242943\">commented</a> in the meeting saying he, too, felt ignored, &#8220;For what it&#8217;s worth, I feel like my feedback was ignored as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope we can do another major iteration on the directory, because Iâm not really a fan of the new one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Perhaps the WordPress backend will make it easier to make incremental improvements in the future, as being on bbPress before was often cited as the reason things were slow to iterate previously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Mullenweg&#8217;s feedback in June 2016, was not public, his recent comments indicate not much has changed between then and now.</p>\n<p>Alex Shiels, a member of Team Apollo at Automattic, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826698320557\">says</a> user feedback wasn&#8217;t ignored. &#8220;Itâs not that anyoneâs feedback has been ignored; just that weâve had limited resources and a big back-end component to the project, and a lot of conflicting requests&#8221; he said. &#8220;Iâll make sure to give a clear invitation to provide feedback in the announcement post, and include something about future iteration.</p>\n<h2>The Inability to Measure the Impacts of the Redesign</h2>\n<p>Kevin Hoffman, who participated in discussions on trac about <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1828\">how to display screenshots</a>, asked if there was any user data and feedback that the Meta team could share that led to some of the decisions and changes that were made. For example, changes to the UI or how often the Read more links are clicked. Shiels <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490826026176187\">responded</a> that the team does not have that data because they don&#8217;t have the tools to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is Google Analytics tracking, but access is very limited and from what Iâve seen of it (I donât have direct access) itâs messy and hard to draw objective conclusions from,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;I absolutely agree that analytics and A/B testing would be great, but we just donât have the tools for it right now. I think that needs to be considered a next step, but a separate project by itself really.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoffman stepped back from contributing to the redesign after receiving <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1828#comment:41\">this response</a> seven months ago from Sidler on Trac where he says much of the feedback received was from plugin developers and not representative of users.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, we&#8217;re building the site for users, not developers. Certainly some of our users are developers, but not the vast majority. One of the WordPress core philosophies is building first for the 80%, not the 20%, and that applies in this case as well.</p>\n<p>Second, almost all of the &#8216;overwhelming community feedback&#8217; we&#8217;ve received so far is from plugin authors who are (typically) developers. It&#8217;s all great feedback and we&#8217;re obviously listening closely. But it&#8217;s not necessarily representative of the users who visit the plugin directory regularly. We&#8217;ll certainly run user tests before launching, and we can probably run a more obvious beta, with a link from the current directory to the new one. But the directory isn&#8217;t yet ready for that.</p>\n<p>Third, this &#8216;self-imposted limitation&#8217; as you call it is not arbitrary. Rather, it&#8217;s the result of research and in-person discussion with a number of designers. Will it be the final design? I dunno. But since we haven&#8217;t tested it with real users (see the paragraph above), it&#8217;s hard to say right now. I think pursuing this direction is worthy for a number of reasons, which aren&#8217;t really worth rehashing here. First and foremost though, until we build out a product that can run through user tests, we won&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the right direction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>How can the team know that the redesign is working or is the right direction if WordPress.org doesn&#8217;t have the tools necessary to measure its impacts? There&#8217;s also the question of what data was obtained or user testing done that supports the decisions that were made? Who are these users and how does the team know what the best user experience is for them?</p>\n<h2>Iteration Is the WordPress Way</h2>\n<p>Now that the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/03/30/announcing-the-new-wordpress-plugin-directory/\">new directory</a> is publicly available, the Meta team is reviewing feedback, gathering bug reports, and organizing tickets on Trac.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If there are tickets that were closed or postponed during the project that you think need revisiting, then this would be a great time to start reviewing and re-opening them,&#8221; Shiels said. &#8220;We already have a bunch of tickets against the future milestone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new directory has been built with future maintainability and iterative enhancementÂ in mind. Weâre looking forward to hearing feedback from the whole WordPress community, and making regular improvements and additions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To report a bug or enhancement with the plugin directory, you&#8217;re encouraged to <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=Plugin+Directory\">create a ticket on Trac. </a>If you have any questions concerning the directory or would like to get more involved, visit <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/meta/\">#meta</a> on Slack.</p>\n<h2>The Vocal Minority</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of people voicing their complaints about the WordPress Plugin Directory redesign and to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1490897847701262\">summarize them</a> as a vocal minority is unfair.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Letâs also not forget that one of WordPressâs philosophies is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#minority\">The Vocal Minority</a>,&#8221; Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, said in a conversation on the Meta Slack channel concerning feedback. &#8220;Many people being loud on the internet isnât a reason to do anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve documented above, the issues people are complaining about today are roughly the same as those reported during the prototype stage more than seven months ago.</p>\n<p>If months have passed and the issues brought up by members of the community who are part of the so-called vocal minority were not addressed before shipping to the public, can we blame them for complaining and feeling ignored? What about those who think that getting involved to be part of the solution was a waste of time? While the plugin directory design will undoubtedly improve with time, the complaints and concerns expressed by people this week are justified.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 23:04:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress App for Android Adds Better Support for Jetpack-Enabled Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-app-for-android-adds-better-support-for-jetpack-enabled-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1764:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wordpress-for-android.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Automatticâs mobile engineers <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/03/29/full-android-support-for-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">released a major update to WordPress for Android</a> this week. Last year the app&#8217;s users saw a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\" target=\"_blank\">growing disparity</a> between the features available to self-hosted sites and those available to WordPress.com users. Not having the WP REST API in core was holding the app back from providing the same site management features that WordPress.com site owners already enjoy. The upcoming release narrows that gap with better support for Jetpack-enabled sites.</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress sites owners will now have access to People Management, Site Settings, and Site Icons in the app. A complete re-write of the app&#8217;s network layer brings more performance improvements to Stats and other features.</p>\n<p>The Jetpack blog <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/03/29/full-android-support-for-jetpack/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the release but doesn&#8217;t mention that these features are not yet available to all users. If you manage a self-hosted site on your mobile device, you&#8217;ll need to wait until version 7.0 hits the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a>. According to Automattic mobile engineer Maxime Bias, version 7.0 is currently in staged rollout and not all users can update to get it yet. He said 7.0 should be fully rolled out soon but could not give an ETA.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 19:53:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Community Team Releases Plugin That Displays WordPress Events Nearby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67925\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/community-team-releases-plugin-that-displays-wordpress-events-nearby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3309:\"<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-view-upcoming-wordcamps-in-the-wordpress-dashboard\">highlighted a WordPress plugin</a> that displays upcoming WordCamps in the Dashboard. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/03/23/showing-upcoming-local-events-in-wp-admin/\">recently discovered</a> that the WordPress Community team is working on an official plugin that does something similar called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nearby-wp-events/\">Nearby WordPress Events</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin attempts to detect a user&#8217;s location and displays upcoming events within the WordPress News dashboard widget. Events include WordCamps and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/topics/wordpress/\">Meetups</a> from Meetup.com. If the location detected is incorrect, users can click the pencil icon and change it to their city and state.</p>\n<img />Nearby WordPress Events Dashboard Widget\n<p>The bottom of the widget includes links to the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">WordPress Meetups landing page</a>, WordCamp schedule, and the official WordPress news blog. If your site has multiple users, each one can configure the widget to display events near their locations.</p>\n<p>According to Ian Dunn, the API includes any meetups that are within a 100 kilometer radius. For WordCamps, the radius is 350 kilometers.</p>\n<p>Here is what the radius looks like for WordPress Meetups.</p>\n<img />US WordPress Meetup Radius\n<p>Here is what the radius looks like for WordCamps.</p>\n<img />US WordCamp Radius\n<p>The distances can not be modified but, depending on feedback, they can be increased to be more accommodating.</p>\n<p>WordCamp data is gathered using an <a href=\"https://api.wordpress.org/events/1.0/\">API endpoint on</a> WordPress.org. The initial HTTP request is performed asynchronously so it doesn&#8217;t affect page loading times. The response is cached for 12 hours to avoid making unnecessary requests.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Community team created the plugin to generate more awareness of WordPress events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The community that has been created around WordPress is one of its best features, and one of the primary reasons for its success, but many users are still unaware that it exists, and arenât taking advantage of all of the resources that it makes available to them,&#8221; Dunn said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Inviting more people to join the community will help to increase its overall health, diversity, and effectiveness, which in turn helps to ensure that WordPress will continue to thrive in the years to come.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think that wp-admin is the perfect place to display these events, because thatâs the place where almost all WordPress users are visiting already. Instead of expecting them to come to us, we can bring the relevant information directly to them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.8 Alpha and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. Users can report bugs on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nearby-wp-events\">plugin&#8217;s support forums</a> or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/nearby-wordpress-events/issues\">project&#8217;s GitHub page</a>.

The redesign spent more than six months in beta for feedback and testing, but many contributors on the project said they felt their feedback was not taken into account. The result is that the new design shipped but has not been well received by the community. Most users and developers welcome the changes to the search algorithm, but the new UI for the plugin pages has received quite a bit of negative feedback.</p>\n<p>One of the unpopular changes made during this refresh was the removal of individual plugin stats, which can now only be viewed by plugin admins. The decision may be temporary but depends on feedback from users.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re missing plugin stats after the redesign, check out the new <a href=\"http://wpstats.me/\" target=\"_blank\">wpstats.me</a> site. WordPress plugin developer <a href=\"https://wpartisan.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Dakin</a> created it in just a few hours using the WordPress.org API&#8217;s. Visitors can enter a plugin&#8217;s slug and see recent and all-time download stats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wpstats.me_.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I like checking out plugin stats, seeing which are popular, how others are doing, etc, so I put together a quick something to do that and thought others might find it useful,&#8221; Dakin said. WPstats.me is essentially a one-page app so Dakin opted to host it on GitHub pages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CSS is done with <a href=\"http://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyons</a> (Iâm super into function CSS at the moment), the JS is Backbone for the routing, jQuery for the ajax stuff, and Underscore for the templating,&#8221; Dakin said. He said the hardest part of putting the site together was finding the WordPress.org APIs, as the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> is sparse and out of date.</p>\n<p>If the Meta team decides to bring stats back into the plugin page design, Dakin said he will consider leaving WPstats.me up anyway if people are finding it useful. Some users like to see how stats have changed over time and developers appreciate being able to check up on their competition.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress.org plugin developer, Dakin is directly affected by the changes to the directory. He is considering changing how he markets his plugins and is hoping for improvements to the UI that was shipped this week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the improvements to the search a lot,&#8221; Dakin said. &#8220;In terms of the page redesign I like that theyâre trying, but I donât think itâs quite there yet. Like many others, I feel that the collapsing sections is a bit of a poor use of space. And yes, I havenât done anything yet but I will be experimenting with restructuring plugin readme&#8217;s so the important points are immediately visible and not hidden on page load.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 19:12:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: WordPress Polyglots Team Calls for Volunteers to Organize Global Translation Day Three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68066\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-polyglots-team-calls-for-volunteers-to-organize-global-translation-day-three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2111:\"<p>The WordPress Polyglots team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2017/03/29/global-wordpress-translation-day-3-call-for-organisers/\">asking for volunteers</a> to help organize <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Global Translation Day Three</a>.

Joe Guilmette, team lead at <a href=\"http://www.wpallimport.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP All Import</a>, opened up Poopy.life to the public today, offering free unlimited WordPress installs for anyone who needs a temporary site.</p>\n<p>After verifying that you&#8217;re not a robot, Poopy.life creates a test install and sends you to the admin where you can see credentials for logging in and sharing the site. The install expires after a week, unless manually extended with the button in the admin. It also allows you to create a sandbox template that can be shared via a URL so that others can quickly create a duplicate install.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/poopy-test-install.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The platform also has a secret menu, like <a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/eat/los-angeles/the-in-n-out-secret-menu-ranked\" target=\"_blank\">In-N-Out Burger</a>, that allows you to add URL parameters to spin up sites even faster with certain actions already taken:</p>\n<p><strong>No URL Parameters</strong><br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create/</code></p>\n<p><strong>Copy an existing install</strong><br />\n?src=[Sandbox ID]&amp;key=[auth key]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?src=panicky-pheasant&key;=EuT9WPIm8122WCcq</code></p>\n<p><strong>Redirect URL</strong><br />\n?url=[redirect URL]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?url=/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sandbox</code></p>\n<p><strong>Send a welcome email</strong><br />\n?email=[email address]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?email=user@example.com</code></p>\n<p><strong>Activate Plugins</strong><br />\n?activate_plugins=[plugin_slug_1],[plugin_slug_2],[etc]<br />\n<code>http://poopy.life/create?activate_plugins=akismet,wordpress-importer</code></p>\n<h3>Poopy.life Platform Will Add a Commercial Tier at WPSandbox.io in the Near Future</h3>\n<p>Although Poopy.life is both memorable and amusing, the team chose the domain to prevent people from using it in their own product demos and support channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose poopy.life specifically because it is ridiculous and no one will be able to use it in a professional context,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;Also it was shorter than the previous domain we were going to use &#8211; oxygen-is-really-amazing-and-everyone-loves-it.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Poopy.life runs on CloudLinux and Guilmette said it is hosted on &#8220;a handful of very powerful dedicated servers and ~10 smaller helper instances/load balancers, and duct tape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP All Import plans to introduce a commercial tier on wpsandbox.io to allow users to have installs on a custom domain, as well as control of the welcome notice and email. The poopy.life domain and landing page will live on, but Guilmette expects that it will soon be blacklisted by Google.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress installs are real WordPress installs and you can install any plugin on them,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;You can install a PHP shell and dig around the server and run whatever weird spammy malware you want. There really isnât any way to prevent it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette estimates that Poopy.life is powering approximately 2,000 test installs right now. He doesn&#8217;t know how many their infrastructure can handle, but said they can easily scale it up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We donât really monitor or throttle usage so much as try to make sure that one user isnât able to negatively impact another,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;If the service grows in popularity, there will probably be some pain points that weâll need to address. But weâve been doing this for a long time and have worked out many of the kinks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team has been using a version of the Poopy.life platform on <a href=\"http://www.wpallimport.com/try/\" target=\"_blank\">wpallimport.com/try/</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oxygenapp.com/try/\" target=\"_blank\">oxygenapp.com/try/</a> for several years. In addition to being a fun, free tool they could offer to the public, the platform has also been critical to the success of the company. It allows users to test WP All Import and Oxygen products before purchasing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Poopy.life is basically magical golden dogfood weâve been eating for years,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;This platform is huge for us. Back before we got serious about this we were hosting it on a VPS at MediaTemple, just kind of hacking it together. It would go down all the time, and whenever it did it would throw our support channel into disarray and sales would drop by 50%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette said the most important thing WP All Import customers want to know is if the product will be able to import their files. The testing platform drives sales for the company and reduces refunds and buyer&#8217;s remorse, because customers know exactly what they are getting. It also has proven to reduce support requests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get way fewer simple questions about the UI, because people can just try it,&#8221; Guilmette said. &#8220;So that clears support up for people who have real problems. It also makes those support requests easier, because the user can reproduce the problem on a debug install, and we can poke at it without worrying about breaking their site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guilmette said the team is working on launching the commercial tier and may have something ready within a couple of weeks or sooner with the help of testers.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 19:36:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"HeroPress: WordPress: A Tool for Success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-tool-success/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12379:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/032917-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was not an obvious choice for a successful web person, but WordPress helped me reach my goals.\" /><p>I was a college teacher for most of my life. When my fourth baby arrived, I gave up a travel-heavy university job and took a âmommy jobâ as a bookstore manager. I chose books, held teacher workshops, and read stories to children for 15 years. As the internet became important, we put up a website and I became the manager of that site. 18 months later, the bookstoreâs owners went bankrupt and closed the store.</p>\n<p>My initial reaction was, âThey canât do that â weâre #2 on Google!â Weâd also gone from zero ecommerce sales to $5,000 a month. We had visitors to our blog from 192 different countries. Online, we were a success. But it was 2008, and lots of small businesses were going under. Lots of people were unemployed. I was unemployed for the first time in my life.</p>\n<p>Being #2 or even #1 on Google had a different meaning in those days, before customized search results. For me, it meant that I had become skilled with SEO and content marketing, but I figured Iâd have to return to the classroom when my job ended.</p>\n<blockquote><p>âWe couldnât have done this without you,â the owner of the bookstore said. âThere are other businesses that would benefit from your skills. Why donât you go into business helping them?â</p></blockquote>\n<p>I scoffed bitterly. I had kids in college and two more getting ready to finish high school. I clearly needed a higher level of security than self-employment could offer.</p>\n<p>Whatâs more, I had already discovered that people who found out what I did with computers invariably looked at me oddly and said, âYou donât look like a computer guy.â They were right, although we now have a much more open minded idea of what computer guys can look like. Back then, though, I looked like someoneâs mom. I was someoneâs mom. This caused a high level of cognitive dissonance for some people, I knew.</p>\n<p>But I was bold enough to do a little bit of helping other businesses while I looked for work. I wrote an essay at the site that was then SEOMoz and got a job offer in the comments. I picked up a couple of local clients, and then through an online marketplace found some international clients. I went to job interviews, of course, and was offered jobs managing various things. But nothing I was offered was as fun as the work I was doing online. I turned down all the offers I received.</p>\n<h3>The Web People</h3>\n<p>I clearly remember my last job interview. It was Halloween 2008. I was talking with the vice chancellor at a medical school about his online needs. This was my first IRL tech job interview and the vice chancellor had told me I was his favorite candidate. The secretary came to the door and said, âWe need to take Rebecca down to the basement to meet the Web People.â</p>\n<p>She was dressed as a witch. The hallways were full of cotton spider webs and spooky decorations. She was taking me down to the basement to meet the Web People. I was the only one who laughed.</p>\n<p>You see the humor, right? They did not. I realized that I didnât really want to go back to academia, I didnât want to manage things, and I didnât want to sit in a cubicle proofreading. I wanted to have fun with websites.</p>\n<p>I talked with my family about the possibility of going into business for myself, and the possibility that I could fail and limit their college choices. My youngest son said, âYouâve always done whatâs best for us. You should do whatâs best for you.â<br />\nI have great kids.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At that point, I reviewed my income figures, saw that I was earning twice as much as I had earned as a bookstore manager, and decided that I would carry on as an independent Web Person.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a freelance web writer and SEO, I never met a CMS I couldnât make friends with. If there wasnât a CMS at a website, I used Dreamweaver. Drupal, Joomla, Mango, sticks and clay tablets, I didnât care. I used WordPress along with all the other options my clients wanted. In 2009, after being featured in the Wall Street Journal, my freelance business boomed. I teamed up with designers and built websites in addition to writing for web designers and agencies and businesses on four continents.</p>\n<p>My eldest daughter, Rosie, saw that I needed some help and came to work with me. âSaw that I needed some helpâ may be too kind a way to put it. I have some useful skills, but my main goal for my business was not to starve in the gutter and my main goal for accounting was to keep out of jail. We met with the local Small Business Association rep a couple of months after Rosie joined me and he said to me, kindly but firmly, âYouâd be in trouble without her.â</p>\n<p>But with Rosie as my partner, I was able to build a thriving business. In 2010 we built a WordPress site for K-12 teachers just in time for our first WordCamp. We needed a lab site, and I had just finished writing a bunch of lesson plans with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In the course of that project I had discovered how limited online STEM (science, tech, engineering, and math) options for K-12 teachers were. We built a website called FreshPlans to help fill that need and had a functioning WordPress site for WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>0 to 8,000 in six months</h3>\n<p>Six months later, Rosie and I were looking at the stats for FreshPlans â 8,000 visits a month â and she said, âWhy arenât we doing this for our own website? Why arenât we doing this for all our clients?â</p>\n<p>I didnât have a good answer for why we werenât doing it, but we went ahead and switched our business site to WordPress. We convinced our designer to give WordPress a chance and built WordPress websites for clients who needed new sites. We saw how much more sense the websites made to our clients. We saw how much more quickly we could build the sites and how much more value we could provide for our clients without the cost of bringing in a developer. We found that we were able to streamline our process for the clients whose blogging and social media we look after. We saw impressive results for our clients, too; not every website can go from 0 to 8,000 visits in six months, but we definitely see better results with WordPress than without it.</p>\n<p>Within a year, we went from platform agnostic to a dedicated WordPress shop. It worked better for us. It worked better for the people whose sites we built and managed. We were also beginning to see the value of open source and to appreciate the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>After that first WordCamp, I spoke at a couple of camps every year and our company sponsors and helps organize a couple of WordCamps nearly every year. Last year I spoke at three and I hope to continue expanding that service. WordPress has been good to us and we want to give back to the awesome WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Success</h3>\n<p>Our business has grown. My eldest son graduated from college and joined the family business. My second daughter left us to work for Automattic. Weâve had some rough times, as every business does, but we can be proud of the work we do.</p>\n<p>We have the privilege of working with awesome clients, both locally and around the world. They can share their brands and their bigger messages in ways that would have been difficult and costly just a decade ago. Weâre able to get great results for them â with hard work and WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress is not a magic pixie dust you can sprinkle on your website for instant success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there are some things about WordPress that set you up for success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It may not be true (okay, it isnât true) that you can master WordPress with no tech skills, training, or effort. But you donât have to be a programmer to get the results you want and need in WordPress. If you have something to say, you can get it published more easily in WordPress than with other platforms.</li>\n<li>Thereâs no quality tradeoff. We usually build custom websites with talented and trained designers, but Iâve built dozens myself with pre-made themes and my own HTML and CSS skills (and great photos â the secret weapon for non-artists who want to create beautiful WordPress websites). Either way, youâre not limited by WordPress as you are by drag-and-drop sitebuilding tools.</li>\n<li>Because updating and adding content is so easy with WordPress, you can accomplish the essentials of content marketing more easily. You can focus on your message with less worry about the medium. You and your Web People can shape the web experience you want for your visitors efficiently.</li>\n<li>WordPress has the most supportive community you can find. Weâre friends with local companies that we could also call competitors, because we spend time together in Meetups and WordCamp organizing meetings. We also have a large network of WordPress folks we respect and admire. Itâs great to see them in person at WordCamps, but we also have the opportunity to get to know them better virtually. We help them and they help us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can say from experience that WordPress has made a big difference in my life. Iâm still a mom â in fact, Iâm now a grandmother. But Iâm also the owner of a successful web firm and a successful educational website. I write for and care for a number of websites I can be proud of.</p>\n<p>Last year at WordCamp Kansas City a man came up to show me his new website. I had spoken the year before about how to get started with a WordPress website, and he had been able to build a site for his fantasy hockey league. He was excited to show it to me, and I was excited to see it.

The app has a refreshed interface for translating .PO files, which Poedit creator VÃ¡clav SlavÃ­k said was created by a professional designer. It is also the first paid upgrade for Pro users since the app <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/poedit-adds-pro-support-for-wordpress-theme-and-plugin-translation\" target=\"_blank\">added support for WordPress theme and plugin translations</a> in 2013.</p>\n<p>Poedit 2 introduces direct connectivity support for WordPress, allowing developers to connect directly to the server instead of working with unpackaged plugins/themes locally.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress_connect@2x.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a><br />\n&#8220;Putting translation files on the server was the most common source of problems in Poedit (too many things can go wrong if youâre not yet very familiar with WP) and this feature should help a lot with that,&#8221; SlavÃ­k said.</p>\n<p>This release adds support for <a href=\"http://twig.sensiolabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Twig templates</a> and <a href=\"https://upstatement.com/timber/\" target=\"_blank\">Timber</a>. In the past, users had difficulty extracting strings from Twig templates, requiring some fragile workarounds. SlavÃ­k said some users resorted to setting up Poedit to treat them as Python files. Poedit 2 has a new built-in extractor for Twig.</p>\n<p>Poedit 2 also introduces a new pre-translation feature that allows for batch pre-translation of the entire PO file at once using Poedit&#8217;s online database and machine translation. After this has processed, users can then read through and correct any errors. SlavÃ­k said this feature saves a lot of time for many WordPress-related translations, such as themes, where a lot of strings are often repeated.</p>\n<p>Poedit used to be available from the Mac App Store but is now distributed exclusively from the <a href=\"https://poedit.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Poedit.net</a> website. The latest release drops support for older operating systems and requires users to be on Windows 7 or newer, macOS 10.10 Yosemite, or a modern Linux distribution.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 01:02:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Data From Theme Reviews Shows Authors Need More Education on Developing Secure WordPress Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://wptavern.com/data-from-theme-reviews-shows-authors-need-more-education-on-developing-secure-wordpress-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4489:\"<p>Last week, we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-making-progress-on-clearing-out-1000-review-backlog\">highlighted the progress</a> being made by the Theme Review Team in clearing out a 1K+ review backlog. In an effort to determine common problems with themes discovered by reviewers, Carolina Nymark, a member of the Theme Review Team, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2017/03/25/review-statistics/\">reviewed 100 tickets</a> from 531 themes that were closed and marked not approved between December and February. Nymark cautions that the data does not assure statistical accuracy and is not representative of the entire directory.</p>\n<p>Her assessment shows that the most common problems discovered by reviewers were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing escaping or using the wrong functions: 23 themes</li>\n<li>Text that is not translation ready: 21 themes</li>\n<li>Missing prefix: 20 themes</li>\n<li>Scripts or styles are not enqueued: 18 themes</li>\n<li>PHP notices, errors or warnings: 12 themes</li>\n<li>Style tags does not correspond with theme functionality, or are deprecated: 10 themes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nymark also reviewed 100 out of 177 new themes that went live between December and February. Out of these themes, the most common problems were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing escaping or using the wrong functions: 51 Themes</li>\n<li>Text that is not translation ready: 44 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing prefix: 39 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing license or copyright information for included assets: 34 Themes</li>\n<li>Unused code or files: 25 Themes</li>\n<li>PHP notices, errors or warnings: 20 Themes</li>\n<li>Missing sanitization, or using the wrong functions: 18 Themes</li>\n<li>Options in the customizer that are not working: 18 Themes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last Friday, Jose Castaneda,Â Ulrich Pogson, and Nymark participated in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2017/03/27/chat-with-matt-about-the-future-of-theme-repo/\">voice chat</a> with Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress project, to discuss the future of the theme directory. The team discussed ideas around automation, improving the theme preview experience, and content portability. One of the experiments Mullenweg proposed is to remove the manual review process and rely more on user feedback. Feedback could include, tags, reviews, and other meta data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As we are not sure if the process will function without manual reviews, we willÂ start working on getting better user feedback on themes,&#8221; Pogson said. &#8220;Once we have a good infrastructure in place we can experiment with how the repository reacts with no manual reviews.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We discussed the process we would go about making decisions on changes to the theme repository and came to the consensus that a direct democracy is too fragile and representative democracy would be a better solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Security, code errors, and prefixing, were also mentioned in the conversation as the most common issues encountered with themes. The team was given a series of tasks to complete and will report the results to Mullenweg at a later date.</p>\n<h2>New Theme Check Plugin Will Detect Common Security Issues</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/about/\">Theme Handbook</a> doesn&#8217;t have a chapter on security but it does link to a series of articles on writing secure themes in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/resources/\">resources section</a>. Justin Tadlock, Key Reviewer, says work is underway on a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">Theme Check</a> plugin that will automatically detect security issues commonly seen during the manual review process. These include escaping and data sanitization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we could get the greater theme developer community to pitch in and help get this finished, it would be awesome,&#8221;Â Tadlock said. &#8220;Even outside of WordPress.org, ThemeForest and commercial theme shops could really use this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Members of the TRT are testing the plugin behind the scenes and are working to eliminate false-positives. The best way to get involved in the project is to view the<a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues\"> Issue tracker</a> and submit pull requests. Once the new theme check plugin is live, it will give authors another tool at their disposal for developing more secure WordPress themes.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:52:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: WordPress Relaunches Plugin Directory with New Design and Improved Search Algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=68018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-plugin-directory-with-new-design-and-improved-search-algorithm\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5396:\"<p>The new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> went live today. Contributors have been working for the past year on rebuilding the directory with a new design and better capabilities for searching through the 45K+ available plugins.</p>\n<p>The new landing page displays a search bar prominently at the top, followed by sections for featured plugins, popular plugins, and beta plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress-plugin-directory.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The design changes to the individual plugin pages have received <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1446257985436411/?match=YWR2YW5jZWQgd29yZHByZXNzLHdvcmRwcmVzcy5vcmcsd29yZHByZXNzLGFkdmFuY2Vk\" target=\"_blank\">mixed feedback from members of Advanced WordPress Facebook.</a> The screenshots slider and FAQ accordion UI are welcome improvements, but many are not fond of how the new single plugin display ditches the previous tabbed interface in favor of truncated sections with numerous &#8220;read more&#8221; links. This requires the visitor to click and scroll repeatedly through a massive wall of text. The experience of doing this to find information is much less efficient than the previous tabbed UI.</p>\n<p>Many of the plugin header images appear to be stretched now with the new wider content area, but this may encourage developers to update their listings. Several users have commented that they are disappointed with the removal of stats, which are now viewable for admins only. Plugin team member Mika Epstein said they are waiting for more feedback from end users (not plugin developers) on whether to make them publicly viewable again.</p>\n<p>The new design matches <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-launches-homepage-redesign\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org&#8217;s homepage redesign</a>, which went from sketches to prototype to live during the last few weeks of December 2016. The most exciting improvements, however, are found under the hood.</p>\n<p>The plugin directory is now powered by WordPress, instead of bbPress, making it easier for plugin developers and reviewers to manage plugins, tags/categories, and committers. The submission and review process has also been streamlined so the plugin team will no longer reject plugins after 7 days. They also have to ability to rename plugin slugs prior to approval for easier handling of typos.</p>\n<h3>New Plugin Search Algorithm Delivers More Relevant Results</h3>\n<p>The most significant user-facing improvement in the redesign is better search relevance. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/08/30/initial-analysis-of-plugin-search-logs/\" target=\"_blank\">Analysis of plugin search logs</a> in August 2016 showed the directory handles 100,000 searches per day and receives more than 500k unique search queries per month.</p>\n<p>Greg Ichneumon Brown, a Data Wrangler at Automattic, published an in-depth <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> on how he and contributors improved search fidelity for the new plugin directory. The eye-opening account explains just how opinionated search algorithms need to be in order to give users the best experience at this scale.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In improving the fidelity of search results, itâs not just a question of how we satisfy a single userâs search query, but how we satisfy thousands of users for each unique search term: which plugins will support that volume of users and their requests for support?&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Which are most likely to give all of these users a great WordPress experience?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new search algorithm delivers results based on this premise. Brown added a calculation for the lowest/highest ratio of active_installs to the number of times the search was performed. However, this isn&#8217;t the only factor that influences whether or not a users will have a good experience with the top results. The algorithm also includes signals that Brown said plugin authors have a lot more control over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolving support threads</li>\n<li>Keeping the plugin update to date</li>\n<li>Testing the plugin on the latest versions of WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s <a href=\"https://data.blog/2017/03/15/improving-relevance-and-elasticsearch-query-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> breaks down the Elasticsearch query he developed for the directory and explains how text matching works to find relevant results for author searches, queries that include operators, and partial-word boosting.</p>\n<p>The plugin directory relaunch has several known issues that the plugin team noted in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/03/28/the-new-directory-is-mostly-live/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> today. Users are noticing many broken links, problems with SVN, and other bugs when navigating around the new directory. The team has a list of tickets on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=reviewing&status=new&status=accepted&group=status&milestone=Plugin+Directory+v3.0\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Trac</a> that they are working through and feedback is welcome.

In an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/26/amber-rudd-social-media-firms-must-do-stop-terror/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> published on the Telegraph Sunday morning, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd called on Google, Twitter, and Facebook to take action on extremist content. She also identified Telegram, Justpaste.it, and WordPress.com as smaller platforms through which terrorist activity is spreading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There should be no place for terrorists to hide,&#8221; Rudd told Andrew Marr in an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04y2cnh\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> over the weekend. &#8220;We need to make sure organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, donât provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s attack in London also seems to have reignited the UK government&#8217;s war on encryption, as Rudd said that the security agencies&#8217; inability to crack encrypted messages during an investigation is &#8220;completely unacceptable.&#8221; Masood allegedly used WhatsApp to communicate shortly before the attack.</p>\n<p>The Home Secretary has summoned representatives from a list of online service providers, including Google, Twitter, Facebook, and smaller companies, to a meeting this week to discuss combatting terrorist abuse of these platforms. Automattic would not confirm whether the company has been summoned but it seems likely given that WordPress.com was one of the platforms Rudd highlighted over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Telegraph article strongly linked WordPress.com to terrorism, citing several claims from the Counter Extremism Project that the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/01/how-alleged-isis-videos-are-creating-a-headache-for-wordpress/?utm_term=.bb8acba3d6ff\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> earlier this month:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But most such sites are publicly available and used to spread content. According to US think tank the Counter Extremism Project, WordPress.com sites have played host to beheading videos, firing squads, and a video of a man being shot in the head, emblazoned with the words &#8216;This In the Enemy Of Allah.&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Historically, WordPress.com has been a strong supporter of free speech but posting terrorist propaganda is a violation of its terms of service. The site has a dedicated page outlining the platform&#8217;s stance on <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/terrorist-activity/\" target=\"_blank\">terrorist activity</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While our service is designed to enable users to freely express their ideas and opinions, however controversial, safety is important to us. As such, we donât allow websites of known terrorist groups or genuine calls for violence against individuals or groups on WordPress.com.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com users can <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">report sites</a> they find to be suspicious but the page also emphasizes the platform&#8217;s commitment to free speech:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Please note that the team behind WordPress.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. WordPress.com has a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let internet users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.</p>\n<p>We take all reports seriously, but we wonât remove sites just because they are offensive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com also denies use to individuals, groups, or entities on the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdnlist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Specially Designated Nationals</a> list, maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasuryâs Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear what Home Secretary Rudd is calling for in summoning global tech company representatives to a meeting, but her comments on the Andrew Marr show indicate the government may request closer monitoring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m saying is the best people &#8211; who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, but stopping it being put up in the first place &#8211; are going to be them,&#8221; Rudd said. She also said she is in conversations with the U.S. government to help get all of these companies around the table to agree to stop this kind of content from being published in the first place.</p>\n<p>Automattic would not provide a comment at this time regarding its position on the UK government attempting to curb online extremism by targeting online services. However, the company has a long history of actively pushing back against requests that violate users&#8217; freedom of speech. In 2010, Automattic <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/support-the-first-amendment-with-1-for-all/\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrated its support for freedom of speech by raising awareness about the First Amendment</a>. Automattic&#8217;s General Counsel Paul Sieminski wrote about the company&#8217;s commitment to <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/striking-back-against-censorship/\" target=\"_blank\">strike back against censorship</a> in 2013 after taking to the courts to stand with users against DMCA abuse. In 2014, when tech companies all over the world joined forces to <a href=\"https://thedaywefightback.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protest NSA surveillance</a>, Automattic was among them.</p>\n<p>If Rudd&#8217;s call for tech companies to take &#8220;a more proactive role&#8221; in tackling terrorist abuse ultimately means introducing monitoring that violates users&#8217; privacy and gives government more access, she will be hard-pressed to get cooperation. American companies like Automattic and Apple have already demonstrated they are willing to go to court to protect users&#8217; freedoms and privacy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To help keep our streets safe, we need to rise up against companies like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash\">#Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Whattsapp?src=hash\">#Whattsapp</a> who provide space and comfort to terrorists</p>\n<p>&mdash; Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorriesMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NadineDorriesMP/status/846267877435035648\">March 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The anti-encryption rhetoric surrounding this issue seems manufactured to allow UK government officials to capitalize on a public tragedy in order to push a political agenda. Rudd is unlikely to find many companies in the tech industry that are eager to hand over users&#8217; freedoms and private communications, but hopefully the summit will serve to educate government officials on why it&#8217;s dangerous to legislate backdoors into consumer products.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 22:30:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami 2017 Will Livestream All Sessions this Weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67929\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-2017-will-livestream-all-sessions-this-weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1577:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wordcamp-miami-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2017.miami.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Miami</a> kicked off today with its ancillary workshops for beginners, freelancers, and BuddyPress enthusiasts.

The internet speculated freely about Medium&#8217;s next move after CEO Ev Williams said the company would be taking âa different, bolder approachâ to the problem of driving payment for quality content.</p>\n<p>It turns out the &#8220;bolder approach&#8221; he referenced is a subscription-based model, one that <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/opinion/2017/03/23/ev-williams-lost-goddamn-mind/#.tnw_zZrtqFcj\" target=\"_blank\">skeptics</a> are already eager to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/24/medium_five_bucks_a_month_for_nothing/\" target=\"_blank\">tear apart</a> as many media organizations have struggled to find success with paywalls. Early subscribers will receive access to curated content, a new reading experience, ad-free browsing, and an offline reading list. Medium will be using the subscription revenue to pay writers for content, some of which will be restricted to members only.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will be routing 100% of the revenue from founding members (those who sign up in the first few months) to writers and independent publishers who have important work to do,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Those who have hard-won expertise, do exhaustive research, and think deeply. Those who make us all smarter. Those who maximize our understanding of the world but donât necessarily maximize clicksâââand, therefore, are at a disadvantage amongst the highly optimized algorithm chum being slung by the truckload by low-cost content purveyors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medium&#8217;s new curated content stream will surface the most worthwhile articles from its network, which grew from 1.9 million posts in 2015 to 7.5 million in 2016 posts. Williams identified the types of content members can expect with their subscriptions in a <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/our-approach-to-member-only-content-cfce188261d1#.ciyj1nlir\" target=\"_blank\">followup post</a> viewable only to subscribers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Politics. Whatâs happening behind the headlines. How to think about it. What to do about it.</li>\n<li>Work. Lessons in business, startups, leadership, management, and money.</li>\n<li>Self. Smart takes on how to be your best youâââhappier, healthier, more productive.</li>\n<li>Future. Where the world is goingâââtechnology, trends, what it all means.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For those who have long regarded Medium as the home of hot takes, open letters, and scintillating rants, the new curated content will feature pieces from those who Williams describes as &#8220;doing important work.&#8221; The list above indicates the platform will be promoting a hefty does of spoon-fed thought and self-improvement topics. In order to make money from the people who have it to spend, the blogging silo must focus on helping those with too much information and not enough time to figure out &#8220;how to think about&#8221; important issues.</p>\n<p>Medium is currently <a href=\"https://medium.com/@adamhodgkin/medium-needs-a-business-model-550d3e2ff2ab#.f0ld2suga\" target=\"_blank\">soliciting writers via email</a>, according to one recipient, Adam Hodgkin. This move marks a change in the company where it is essentially becoming a publisher in addition to an aggregator, commissioning content that will deliver that trademark Medium flavor.</p>\n<p>Authors should be aware that articles published behind Medium&#8217;s paywall will lose their potential to go viral. In addition to trading site and content ownership for convenience, those who agree to write for Medium&#8217;s members will be limiting the potential reach their content may have had if it was published in the open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Media is broken,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;And we need to fix it. Iâm super passionate about this. Though weâve changed our approach recently, this has been Mediumâs mission from day one. We saw the feedback loops for publishing content to be a major problem, and we set out to build a new model. Weâve come a long way sinceâââestablishing ourselves as the platform for thoughtfulness, depth, and insight from independent thinkers. But the greater challengeâââchanging the incentives that drive our consumption of media onlineâââhas become even more pressing. Itâs time to double-down.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s something new about this economic model, we have yet to see it. Spotify, Netflix, the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, and many other businesses have successfully implemented the subscription model. Using it to fund the type of content that Medium aims to highlight may not be feasible, however, as consumers tend to gravitate towards free content and news that is read and shared in the open.</p>\n<p>If Medium&#8217;s only option for exiting the <a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2007/03/01/attention_economy_overview/\" target=\"_blank\">attention economy</a> is to further lock down users&#8217; content inside its proprietary silo, the remedy is worse than the disease. Instead of seeing ads on articles available to everyone, subscribers now pay to read content that is selected by and owned by Medium, a company that still needs to find a way to keep the lights on once all the VC money is gone.</p>\n<p>Medium tried the ad-driven publishing model without success and then declared that it was a broken system. Was the model broken because it didn&#8217;t bring Medium enough money to keep paddling on? Or is it fundamentally broken because it &#8220;incentivizes the wrong behaviors,&#8221; as Williams put it? His newfound idealism behind the push to leave the domain of &#8220;ad buyers and social media echo chambers&#8221; appears to be a mask for the lack of a concrete monetization strategy.</p>\n<p>Williams&#8217; closing appeal says everything: &#8220;Join us early, and help us figure it out.&#8221; Medium is still experimenting on publishers to find a way to stay afloat.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 21:24:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: How to Find the Age of a Plugin Hosted in the WordPress Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67923\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-find-the-age-of-a-plugin-hosted-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1554:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress plugin directory</a> provides information such as version requirements, compatibility, last updated, and active installs for plugins.

In addition to these recommendations, WordPress&#8217; strategy in the past has been to cultivate relationships with hosts to help improve host configurations for users. The project recently launched the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/\" target=\"_blank\">Make WordPress Hosting</a> community to facilitate collaboration among those with hosting experience. Participants are currently working on documenting best practices, including recommendations for PHP versions offered, and providing tools for the community.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 19:15:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: On the James Altucher Show\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47188\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://ma.tt/2017/03/on-the-james-altucher-show/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:450:\"<p>I <a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2017/03/matt-mullenweg/\">joined in for the James Altucher podcast in an episode that covered a lot of ground</a>.

Sucuri, founded by Daniel Cid and co-founded by Tony Perez in 2010, is a website security platform that helps clean and protect websites. Details of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp\">ManageWP</a>, Sucuri will operate as a separate entity under the GoDaddy umbrella. Sucuri employees will transfer to GoDaddy while remaining under the leadership of Perez and Cid.</p>\n<p>Out of all the companies that Sucuri could have chosen to be acquired by, why GoDaddy?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the years we&#8217;ve seen them live up to their words to be a customer and product centric company,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;As a product company it give us an opportunity to scale our product from a few hundred thousand domains, to millions. It&#8217;s something that we only ever dreamed of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The acquisition comes a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/blog/sg-site-scanner-powered-sucuri/\">SiteGround announced</a> its partnership with Sucuri and renamed its site scanner SG Site Scanner. It&#8217;s too soon to determine how this acquisition will affect Sucuri&#8217;s partnerships with hosting companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for our partners, but I truly hope they will trust in us, Sucuri, and in me personally,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;If we can work to deploy our technology for GoDaddy, at their scale, then I have nothing but confidence we can do this for every other partner out there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GoDaddy made this investment because they believe in what we have built as a team at Sucuri, the product solves problems, that doesn&#8217;t go away and I hope all our customers and partners will give us time to prove this in our actions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both companies acknowledged that nothing changes for existing Sucuri customers and that they can expect to see numerous improvements in the near future. Perez and Cid see the acquisition as version 2.0 of the company.</p>\n<p>Aaron Campbell, WordPress Security Team Lead who is sponsored by GoDaddy to work on WordPress full-time, says the move should help make more sites secure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GoDaddy is committed to offering great services to its clients,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;You know as well as I do that Sucuri is exactly that; we&#8217;ve seen them be quite an asset to the WordPress community over the years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to remain a standalone product, but I&#8217;m excited to see them become part of the GoDaddy team to make some great stuff together. Keeping as many WordPress users secure as possible is obviously my goal and I really think this will help accomplish that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reactions to the news on Twitter have mostly been positive with many congratulating Sucuri and its founders.</p>\n<p>On the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/?ref=group_cover\">Advanced WordPress Facebook group</a>, reactions to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1440220396040170/\">the news</a> are a mix between congratulatory and fears of Sucuri&#8217;s service declining. These are among the same grievances and fears expressed by ManageWP customers when <a href=\"https://managewp.com/managewp-joins-godaddy\">GoDaddy acquired it</a>.</p>\n<h2>ManageWP Customers Report No Noticeable Decline in Service</h2>\n<p>Since being acquired, ManageWP has maintained and improved service levels while continuing to add features. Its most recent feature gives customers the opportunity to create backups, restore, and clone <a href=\"https://managewp.com/multisite-websites-in-managewp\">multisite websites</a>.</p>\n<p>Bob Dunn, of <a href=\"https://bobwp.com/\">BobWP</a>, says the service has been stellar before and after the transition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, their services were great before and still are,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I donât manage a ton of sites, but for my needs, it has been rock solid since I first became a customer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scott Buscemi, co-founder of <a href=\"https://lumenfoundry.com/\">Lumen Foundry</a>, has had a similar experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In all honesty, I haven&#8217;t noticed much of anything since they were acquired &#8211; and that&#8217;s a &#8216;win&#8217; in my opinion,&#8221; Buscemi said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen them push out a pleasant list of bug fixes and features that don&#8217;t affect me, so it&#8217;s great to still see active development on the primary system. GoDaddy has been working hard to get on the good side of developers and agency owners like me, so I can&#8217;t imagine they would go through the effort of the acquisition only to spoil the experience and turn things negative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even those skeptical with the acquisition have reported no noticeable decline in the quality of service.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> Me, I havenât really noticed any change in the quality of the service (and I was skeptical)</p>\n<p>&mdash; \"so called\" Jim Cook (@jm_cook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jm_cook/status/844657355035938816\">March 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>GoDaddy has not announced how it plans to integrate Sucuri into its products and services.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:53:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress at WordCamp London 2017 Contributor Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=264902\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/03/buddypress-at-wordcamp-london-2017-contributor-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1688:\"<p>Contributor Day is a big part of WordCamp London.

The React-based theme is the first in the directory to use the REST API endpoints included in WordPress 4.7. Foxhound sports a tasteful blog design with single-page app functionality that loads posts instantly. Check out the <a href=\"https://themes.redradar.net/foxhound/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> to see how fast the content loads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/foxhound.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The theme was designed and developed by <a href=\"https://themes.redradar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Dwan and Mel Choyce</a>, who have collaborated on several free themes hosted on WordPress.org. They recommend installing the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/\" target=\"_blank\">WP-API Menus</a> plugin, as the REST API does not yet support menus. After installing Foxhound, there are only two things required to make it look like the demo: Set the front page to display the latest posts and set up a menu. There are no additional customization settings.</p>\n<p>Kelly Dwan notes on <a href=\"https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound\" target=\"_blank\">Foxhound&#8217;s GitHub repository</a> that the theme should be considered &#8220;experimental&#8221; and users can expect a few restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The theme does not display anything if javascript is disabled. (Should not affect SEO or accessibility)</li>\n<li>The API cannot be blocked by a security plugin. Some plugins recommend blocking the users endpoint, but that is required to show the author archive. If you need to block the user endpoint, the rest of the theme should work but might be unstable if anyone tries to visit an author archive.</li>\n<li>Permalinks for pages and archives are changed by this theme. They will be reset if/when you deactivate the theme. You might want to set up redirects using something like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-redirect-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Redirect Manager</a>.</li>\n<li>This theme does not support hierarchical category archives &#8211; only parent category archive pages can be displayed. This <a href=\"https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound/issues/30\" target=\"_blank\">may be fixed in a later version</a> of the theme.\n<li>Plugins may not work as expected, especially if they add content to the front end of the site. Most Jetpack features do still work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because Foxhound is so different from traditional WordPress themes, it could not go through the usual theme review process. Themes that require the WP REST API are currently reviewed outside of WordPress.org when a theme author pings the Theme Review team. They apply a &#8220;Special Case&#8221; tag that allows the theme to bypass Theme Check. (The tag is also used for other themes that break the rules in innovative ways.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a lot to go on yet with those types of themes,&#8221; Key Reviewer Justin Tadlock said. &#8220;Foxhound was the first. We&#8217;re supposed to be looking over another soon. As more of these types of themes come in, we&#8217;ll be able to figure out ways of making it easier to submit them.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 19:21:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"HeroPress: A Blissful Driving Force\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9085:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/032217-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress successfully justified my choice of not joining the job placement drive at college.\" /><p>As a college guy, I believed in being different and outperforming the best of my lot. Coming from a modest family background, the realization of achievement dawned over me. I never favored being a 9 to 5 corporate professional and a having a âbossâ was simply not my cup of coffee. I was never interested in the classes held in the college because I was being more productive at the ârealityâ front of the life. I envisioned getting involved in tasks that were strongest at the core.</p>\n<h3>Where It All Started</h3>\n<p>Computer technology was in its nascent state in India the time I started my tryst with web pages. I began with designing my own collegeâs alumni website while pursuing MCA at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Eventually, I was assigned the task of the event websites too. I was happy because all this brought about a sense of power to me. Though not initially refine, my work still appealed to many and it also made me realize the power technology had.</p>\n<h3>The Seed of Seriousness</h3>\n<p>The very first seed of the idea of taking this up as a serious profession was sown by a friend who told me about how creating web pages and blogging could be a source of monetization. Google pages was my first shot as a techie, wherein I started with contributing content through blogs to several clients.</p>\n<h3>Saw and Attempted</h3>\n<p>I can still recollect the time I received my first pay cheque. Initially, I had tested all Content management systems and had started with Joomla and Drupal. With absolutely no knowledge about coding, I went forward to scale the web designing mountain. WordPress came and was well recognized as a blogging platform; suitable to what I worked on. I bumped into WordPress in 2009 and like many other users, utilized it for my blogging endeavors. Little did I know that someday it would be the answer to my âcoding gapâ. I remember working on a 6-month project for my MCA final where I took up WordPress as the core subject and in there I talked about custom plugins and themes. The teacher was happy to receive the unique project and awarded me good grades for my sense of initiation with new approach.</p>\n<h3>That Leap of Faith</h3>\n<p>Now, I knew how I had to take this WordPress awesomeness forward. With a little exposure to learning new technology, I was baffled for a while but had the will to scale this one too. 6 months, and I thoroughly decoded the WordPress codex for me. This was a giant step forward where my future layÂ in my own hands.</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel that WordPress does not constrict you to a certain limit or a line of functionalities. If you have a core foundation, you can toy with it and make awesome end results. WordPress was now my pillar of strength. WordPressÂ successfully justified my choice of not joining the job placement drive at the college.</p>\n<h3>The Break-Out</h3>\n<p>Now was the time to materialize my skills and have a material turnaround for the work I was capable of doing. After a 4-month hunt for some serious web designing projects with not a single task at hand, disappointment gripped me. The lack of proper work infrastructure due to poor Internet connectivity and local electricity supply were some of the other reasons I had to plan withdrawing my resources from Varanasi. I could have fallen or would have made a leap; it was about to be my choice for the rest of my life.</p>\n<h3>Hello to New Beginnings</h3>\n<p>It was frustrating because Varanasi had been my abode for 7 good years and leaving the place was a huge decision to make. I mustered up my wits to start afresh by withdrawing my base from Varanasi and shifted to Lucknow, India in order to try out seeking new opportunities yet again.</p>\n<p>The work stars favored me and with the help of elance-oDesk (now, Upwork) and other freelancing platforms, I received many life-changing projects of my life. Things moved forward and with many clients in a row, another year went by. I collaborated with more people who were willing to join me on the platform â people who wanted to leave a mark; never to look back. What remained constant throughout these years was my capability to work hard each day.</p>\n<h3>A Better Picture/ Wbcom Designs</h3>\n<p>I upfront admire WordPress because it has been a driving force for my existence. Time has moved slowly and with 6+ years of experience and self-discovery, I now run a fully-fledged WordPress based companyÂ <a href=\"https://wbcomdesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wbcom Designs</a>Â that has many developers and freelancers onboard with me.</p>\n<p>While additionallyÂ serving <a href=\"https://www.buddyboss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyBoss</a> as a Product and Support Manager, now I plan to infuse new changes in the pattern we operate at base as well as the firm through strategic planning. Itâs time to give back to the WordPress community through the development of free plugins, theme customization and spreading the WordPress fandom at local level.</p>\n<p>I recently took the <a href=\"https://2016.nashik.wordcamp.org/wbcomdesigns-is-our-bronze-sponsor/\">opportunity to sponsor</a> <a href=\"https://2016.nashik.wordcamp.org/\">âNashik WordCampâ 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://2017.pune.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Pune 2017</a>, <a href=\"https://2017.udaipur.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Udaipur 2017</a>, and <a href=\"https://2017.kochi.wordcamp.org/sponsors/\">WordCamp Kochi 2017</a>. I am glad I was able to take a step forward in my plans to pay back to the WordPress community. To set the ball rolling at local level, I have recently come up with a local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Lucknow-WordPress-Meetup/\">MeetUp</a> group at Lucknow, India so that locally organized, face to face events can be organized that will accelerate the understanding of the WordPress CMS among the masses. I also plan to bring about WordPress awareness at the school and college level in my zone so that more and more young people know why this CMS is so amazing.</p>\n<p>To this day, my first love is my work desk. Whenever in an emotional or professional fix, I seek recluse through this amazing platform. Unlike others, working destresses me. There is a long way to go with this ideal because I want people to know how powerfully stable the WordPress is.</p>\n<p>Like they say,</p>\n<blockquote><p>âComing together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success.â</p></blockquote>\n<p>I want to see the developer community going for heights that have never been achieved before and I want to be a part of this huge step-up.</p>\n<p>I am all open up for this WordPress community for contribution and assistance. For WordPress enthusiasts, I want to tell them that sky is not the limit. WordPress has accepted me as its own and itâs time for me and others to give back in the best possible manner.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: A Blissful Driving Force\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=A%20Blissful%20Driving%20Force&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: A Blissful Driving Force\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fblissful-driving-force%2F&title=A+Blissful+Driving+Force\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/032217-150x150.jpg&description=A Blissful Driving Force\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/\" title=\"A Blissful Driving Force\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blissful-driving-force/\">A Blissful Driving Force</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 12:00:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Varun Dubey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Help Jesse Petersen and His Family by Donating to His Medical Leave Fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67746\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/help-jesse-petersen-and-his-family-by-donating-to-his-medical-leave-fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2774:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.petersenmediagroup.com/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, a longtime member of the WordPress community and founder of <a href=\"https://www.genesisthe.me/\">Genesis The.me</a>, needs <a href=\"https://www.newlungsfor.me/medical-leave-fund-for-jesses-double-lung-transplant/\">our help</a>. Petersen is battling <a href=\"http://www.cffatboy.com/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/\">Cystic Fibrosis</a> and earlier this year after visiting a clinic, discovered that his lung function was at 22%.</p>\n<p>Due to decrease lung function, Petersen missed five weeks of work, required home IVs, and visited many doctors. He is currently on a double-lung transplant list with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_allocation_score\">lung allocation score</a> of 38.859.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.unos.org/wp-content/uploads/unos/lung_allocation_score.pdf\">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>, the LAS is aÂ score used to prioritize waiting list candidates based on a combination of wait list urgency and post-transplant survival.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain his health for a transplant, doctors have recommended that he work a maximum of two hours per day with quality rest.</p>\n<p>HisÂ family has a small emergency fund available that they thought would allow Petersen to work up until his transplant surgery. However, there&#8217;s no estimated time frame for when a transplant will be available.</p>\n<p>Outside of his product based business, Petersen is a work-from-home freelancer with contract work that needs to be completed. He and his wife have two adopted children. His wife volunteered to get another job to supplement their income but relativesÂ rejected the idea as she is his primary support person.</p>\n<p>Petersen has <a href=\"https://my.genesisthe.me/downloads/genesistheme-developer-starter/\">two products</a> for sale on GenesisThe.me with two more ready for launch by the end of March.</p>\n<p>His family is <a href=\"https://www.newlungsfor.me/medical-leave-fund-for-jesses-double-lung-transplant/\">asking for $20K </a>to help pay for expenses and allow Petersen to take an extended medical leave to focus on his health. So far, the campaign has raised $5,075 or about a quarter of the amount needed.</p>\n<p>You can donate as much as you&#8217;re ableÂ to or choose from one of five predetermined amounts ranging from $25 to $1K. You can also choose to donate monthly in six month increments.</p>\n<p>Petersen is no stranger to the WordPress community&#8217;s generosity. In 2016, it helped him raise nearly $20K to help pay for costs associated withÂ <a href=\"https://surpriseadoption.com/\">adopting his second son</a>. If you are able, please consider donating to Petersen&#8217;s medical leave fund.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 10:35:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Adding Images to WordPress Sidebars Is About to Get a Lot Easier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67667\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/adding-images-to-wordpress-sidebars-is-about-to-get-a-lot-easier\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4041:\"<p>Adding images to sidebars in WordPress is a cumbersome task that requires users to upload an image to the Media Library, find the URL, copy it, and paste it into a Text widget along with additional HTML. Nearly two years ago, Mel Choyce <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32417\">opened a ticket</a> on WordPress Trac proposing that a media widget be added to core. This widget would allow users to easily add images to sidebars.</p>\n<p>Throughout the discussion, the idea of creating a catch-all media widget was brought up that would allow users to add images, audio, or video to a sidebar. After developers spoke to Matt Mullenweg about the direction of the project, the team decided to create three separate widgets to handle each media type. Choyce outlined the benefits this approach provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can focus on creating more tailored experiences for each widget.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ll be able to launch new widgets without having to worry about constantly updating one central widget, or potentially breaking anything.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;ll be easier for people to discover new media types since they won&#8217;t be buried within one widget.</li>\n<li>This will more closely mimic the approach we&#8217;re taking to content blocks in the future, which should provide an easier transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of the three core widgets in development, the Image one is nearly complete ready for user testing. To test, first download and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once activated, navigate to Appearance &gt; Widgets in the WordPress backend and in the available widgets section, locate the Image widget.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget UI\n<p>Clicking the Select Image button displays the media library modal where you can either select or upload an image. Once an image is selected, click the Add to Widget button in the bottom-right corner. This is what the widget looks like after an image is added.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget With an Image\n<p>Here is what the widget looks like on a page using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/\">Twenty Seventeen</a> default theme.</p>\n<img />Core Image Widget in Action\n<p>The core image widget is incredibly easy to set up and is a significant improvement over the Text widget approach. The user interface is much simpler compared to the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/extra-sidebar-widgets/image-widget/\">image widget</a> supplied by Jetpack. Jetpack&#8217;s image widget UI doesn&#8217;t take advantage of the media library modal and instead, requires the user to know the image&#8217;s URL.</p>\n<img />Jetpack Image Widget UI\n<p>Many of the fields are the same as what&#8217;s provided by the media library modal. Not surprisingly, WordPress.com <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/image-widget/\">uses the same interface</a> and requires the user to know the image URL.</p>\n<h2>Core Image Widget May Be Ready in Time for WordPress 4.7.4</h2>\n<p>The team is specifically seeking feedback from those who use image widgets provided by plugins on WordPress.org. Once the image widget is merged into core, the video and audio widgets will be added to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Users can leave the plugin enabled until all three widgets are added to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once a widget has been thoroughly tested by users, we can then copy it into core for a release while then also disabling the widget in the plugin,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>If you encounter a bug or discover an incompatibility with a plugin or theme, please <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues\">create an issue</a> on the project&#8217;s GitHub page. According to Ruter, the team is working hard to get the widget to a point where it can be merged into core. Depending on how testing goes, it could be merged into core as early as WordPress 4.7.4.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 01:18:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Making Progress on Clearing Out 1,000+ Review Backlog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-making-progress-on-clearing-out-1000-review-backlog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6259:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/planning.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/5ZMT04MIW6\">Oli Dale</a>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review team (TRT) has turned a corner and is approaching a major milestone of getting the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/report/2\" target=\"_blank\">review queue</a> under 100 themes.

Themes continue to flow in but are not significantly affecting the queue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/theme-review-ticketgraph.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In 2015 the TRT hit a wall with an influx of themes flooding into a legacy review system that wasn&#8217;t working. The team couldn&#8217;t keep up and was forced to spend much of 2016 changing the review process to better handle the large number of themes coming in. The TRT is working hard to make 2017 the year they get back on track.</p>\n<p>Uzelac identified a few of the measures that have helped in taming the queue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One theme submission per author</li>\n<li>More reviewers</li>\n<li>A new guideline where reviewers close the ticket if the review surfaces more than <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/08/23/meeting-summary-2016-23-08/\" target=\"_blank\">5 distinct issues</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Around Christmas was when many on the team started seeing a tiny sliver of light at the end of a long tunnel,&#8221; Key Reviewer Justin Tadlock said. &#8220;In the past few days, seeing the queue get below 200 themes has been a high point.  Folks on the team are excited because our ideas are paying off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock can&#8217;t say when exactly the team turned a corner but describes it as more of an iterative process that started with small ideas they could implement themselves. This has significantly reduced the wait time from 7 or 8 months a year ago to two months today. Themes also go through an admin queue that adds a bit to the review time but Tadlock said they hope to tackle that in the next Review Shindig, which happens on the first weekend of every month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That number is shrinking,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;By the end of April, we could be looking at 3-4 weeks. I&#8217;m a bit optimistic, so don&#8217;t hold me to that. It could be May or June in reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock said once the team gets to the 50-100 range they will be at the place where they&#8217;re really only handling new themes that are coming in, instead of working the backlog. Once they reach that milestone, they will be able to more accurately track how long it takes for a theme to make it through the review process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll need to really start refining the process so that it works even better in the future,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;A well-coded theme could potentially make it through the process in 2 months right now. Another theme might be 4-5 months. There are a lot of factors to consider. It&#8217;s my hope that we eliminate many of those factors that are holding up the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new rule that limited authors to submitting one theme at a time has had a significant impact on cutting down the queue. The rule was meant to be temporary and will be up for reevaluation when the queue is under 100 themes. Tadlock said the team will likely pull the rule, but it has been instrumental in rooting out copies that contained only minor changes to the original.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For most authors, this [rule] is not a huge problem,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It definitely hurts a few of the more prolific authors in the short term. However, it helps stop the flow of theme companies who are just copying/pasting the same theme with minor changes. We&#8217;ve had theme companies with as many as 17 themes in the queue that were just copies.  This new rule has helped us find those and put a stop to the practice.&#8221; The team was able to track down an entire ring of theme authors with multiple accounts with dozens and dozens of themes.</p>\n<p>Tadlock said most of the issues the team deals with in reviews are related to security. The content portability issues that were highlighted in the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">Zerif Lite suspension</a> are more uncommon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The &#8216;draconian stuff&#8217; people talk about probably represents 1% of the issue,&#8221; Tadlock said, referencing Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue#comment-210935\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the current requirements. &#8220;99% of the issues are the things people don&#8217;t talk about.&#8221; Tadlock has been speaking with theme authors about how they can &#8220;create&#8221; content within the guidelines, as there are ways to do it that are both future-proof and portable.</p>\n<p>The team is currently spending a lot of time reviewing code that shouldn&#8217;t need to be manually reviewed. The next item on the TRT roadmap is incorporating better automation into the review process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The big thing we&#8217;re working on now is the new Theme Check plugin,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to solve lots of problems.  It&#8217;s based off the code sniffer (PHPCS, I believe). It&#8217;ll help theme authors start submitting better coded and more secure themes right off the bat. Humans easily miss those things looking through it with their eyes. This will definitely make theme authors better coders and users will have even more secure themes. Then, we can focus on those 1% issues.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:53:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Yoast SEO 4.5 Urges Users to Upgrade to PHP 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-4-5-urges-users-to-upgrade-to-php-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4770:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yoast-logo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-4-5/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO 4.5</a> was released today with a handful of improvements and, most notably, a big push for users to upgrade to PHP 7.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Yoast SEO 4.5, we are urging site owners whose sites run on servers with an outdated version of PHP to update to a more recent version,&#8221; Joost de Valk said. &#8220;To move the web forward, we need to take a stand against old, slow, and unsafe software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; minimum PHP requirement is still at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" target=\"_blank\">5.2.4</a>, six years after PHP 5.2 <a href=\"http://php.net/eol.php\" target=\"_blank\">reached end of life in 2011</a>. This version is now <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=74&product_id=128&version_id=106044&page=1&hasexp=0&opdos=0&opec=0&opov=0&opcsrf=0&opgpriv=0&opsqli=0&opxss=0&opdirt=0&opmemc=0&ophttprs=0&opbyp=0&opfileinc=0&opginf=0&cvssscoremin=0&cvssscoremax=0&year=0&month=0&cweid=0&order=4&trc=39\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerable to many security issues</a>. Current usage stats show 5.4% of WordPress sites are running on PHP 5.2. As this likely represents millions of users, WordPress&#8217; core leadership is reluctant to bump the minimum requirements. Only 8% of sites are on PHP 7+, as hosting companies are slowly adding support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wordpress-php-versions-march-2017-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>âBecause web hosts are not upgrading PHP, we have decided to start pushing this from within plugins,&#8221; de Valk said. He contends that the WordPress ecosystem is losing good developers because the project is moving too slowly. He also makes the case for security and speed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is sometimes said to be slow, but it actually doesnât have to be slow at all,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If itâs running on old versions of PHP, however, it is, most certainly, slow. PHP 5.2 is more than 100% slower than PHP 5.6, and a whopping <a href=\"https://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/493-php-performance-evolution.html\" target=\"_blank\">400% slower than PHP 7</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>De Valk decided to throw the weight of Yoast SEO, which he estimates to be 6.5 million active installs, behind the movement to push hosts to upgrade their customers to PHP 7. The latest release of the plugin displays a notice to WordPress administrators running sites on PHP 5.2, urging them to upgrade to PHP 7. The notice is &#8220;big, ugly, and non-dismissible,&#8221; de Valk said. It is generated by an error that auto-resolves when the user fixes their outdated PHP version.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The notice will also encourage people to contact their host if they donât know how to upgrade their PHP,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;Yes, this could be painful for some hosts. This notice is deliberately intended to make them work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>De Valk said the plugin will start displaying the notices for PHP 5.2 and will add 5.6 as soon as it is no longer supported. Through experience with his customers, de Valk has found that outdated, slower versions of PHP are damaging Yoast SEO and WordPress&#8217; reputations, as neither are optimized for PHP 5.2. Although older versions are not holding the plugin back from new features, it makes it difficult for the team to clean up the code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many features I cannot build right now, but code quality is suffering because we can&#8217;t use namespaces, short array notation, etc,&#8221; de Valk said.</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team has created <a href=\"https://github.com/Yoast/whip\" target=\"_blank\">WHIP</a>, a WordPress package to nudge users to upgrade their software versions and made it open source for plugin and theme developers to implement in their own extensions. The project includes a filter for linking to the WordPress.org hosting page, which includes a selection of hosts that offer PHP 7.</p>\n<p>Most of the large hosting companies already have documentation for upgrading PHP versions. Ultimately, it&#8217;s the end users who will have the power to get more hosting companies on board. De Valk said he doesn&#8217;t know how big the impact will be but encourages users to vote with their pocketbooks by leaving hosts that are unwilling to assist in upgrading PHP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It might be entirely possible that your host is not willing to work with you,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;If so, think about moving web hosts. A web host provides the engine your site runs on and that better be a damn good engine.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 19:56:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"WPTavern: PressShack Forks Edit Flow to Create PublishPress, Aims to Improve Multi-User Editorial Workflow in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://wptavern.com/pressshack-forks-edit-flow-to-create-publishpress-aims-to-improve-multi-user-editorial-workflow-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6808:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/publish-press.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Last week Steve Burge and the team at <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PressShack</a> released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a>, a fork of Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Flow</a> plugin. PressShack is operated by the same team behind <a href=\"http://ostraining.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OSTraining</a> with a focus on creating publishing plugins for larger organizations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Flow</a> has more than 10,000 active installs but is updated sporadically and is not very well supported. The PressShack creators saw an opportunity to fork the plugin and sell commercial support and add-ons. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a> is now available on WordPress.org with a seamless <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/publishpress/docs/migrate/\" target=\"_blank\">migration for Edit Flow users</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/edit-flow-publishpress-migration.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The first release offers the same features as Edit Flow along with a complete face lift, making interaction with the plugin&#8217;s settings more user-friendly. The new tabbed interface puts all the settings on one screen. PressShack has also tweaked the language of the plugin, changing Story Budgetâ to âOverviewâ, and simplifying other terms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/publishpress-ui.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>PublishPress introduces a few changes to the calendar, allowing users to click anywhere on a date to add content. It exposes the iCal or Google Calendar feed and uses icons to show post statuses, saving space for other information.</p>\n<p>Burge said that PublishPress will be making a fresh start and will not be following and incorporating updates from Edit Flow. The team plans to add a host of new features that improve the publishing workflow to handle multiple users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multisite and multiple site support</strong>: Content creators log into one site but can publish to multiple sites</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-publishing checklists</strong>: For example, featured image, word count, Yoast SEO green light</li>\n<li><strong>More use cases beyond media sites</strong>: In addition to magazine-style user groups for reporting, PublishPress plans to add more use cases, such as WooCommerce products, EDD downloads, bbPress topics, and The Events Calendar listings</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple authors</strong>: Assign multiple author bylines to a story</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these feature are slated for release in mid-2017 and will be <a href=\"https://pressshack.com/publishpress/\" target=\"_blank\">offered as commercial add-ons</a>. The team is currently still focused on writing unit tests for the core plugin and adding improvements to it on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>PressShack Takes Inspiration from Drupal for Expanding Content Workflows</h3>\n<p>PressShack&#8217;s creators also work closely with other open source publishing platforms. Burge said the team took some inspiration from the Drupal ecosystem, which offers more advanced features for modifying editorial workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Drupal, the workflow features are being demanded and developed by large organizations that use the platform,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;As a result, Drupal does have a very big head start in this area. &#8220;In Drupal 7, the main workflow module was called <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench\" target=\"_blank\">Workbench</a>. It was built to meet the needs of large customers such as universities, media outlets, and government agencies who have many different content managers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to having editorial workflow tools available, Burge said that Drupal agencies kept losing projects to rivals such as Adobe and OpenText, because they had publishing workflows built for multiple users. Building better publishing tools became a necessity for Drupal agencies that wanted to win projects from large organizations.</p>\n<p>Drupal 8 moves many of these editorial workflow improvements into core. Drupal 8.3, which is slated for April 2017, will <a href=\"http://buytaert.net/moving-the-drupal-8-workflow-initiative-along\" target=\"_blank\">introduce the ability to create multiple types of content workflows</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whatâs really interesting about the Drupal 8 implementation is that they are thinking beyond just content publishing,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It will soon be possible to put whole sections of your site into a workflow. The demand for these features is still coming from enterprise customers: much of the work is being done by a team of Drupal developers inside Pfizer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burge cited a few examples of typical users requiring more elaborate publishing workflows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A university with 50+ academic departments and several hundred content creators</li>\n<li>A pharmaceutical company with hundreds of products and a micro-site for each one</li>\n<li>A newspaper that employs writers and at least one layer of editors</li>\n<li>A publicly-listed company that needs approval from several staff members to ensure that the content it publishes is 110% accurate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress core is tailored to a single-author blog workflow, and there are relatively few plugins that modify the default editorial workflow for large teams. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/coschedule-a-viable-alternative-to-the-edit-flow-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">CoSchedule is one alternative to Edit Flow</a> and PublishPress that has 10,000 active installs. It takes a SaaS approach and has more of a content marketing slant. Burge said he thinks the WordPress ecosystem&#8217;s scarcity of options for extending publishing workflows may be due to current limitations in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Itâs possible there are some technical hurdles: for example, WordPress core has fairly limited user permissions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Itâs also possible that now is the right time for WordPress to start adding these features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress agencies are building more enterprise sites and these demands are popping-up,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;Matt just announced the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/03/wordpress-collaborative-editing/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Docs integration</a> as a quick way to bring some collaborative features into WordPress. I think weâll see more and more tools available for teams, rather than single authors.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 21:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Donncha: How to Auto Schedule WordPress Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89500175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://odd.blog/2017/03/18/how-to-auto-schedule-wordpress-posts/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3613:\"<p>If you post to a WordPress blog on a regular basis like I do on <a href=\"https://inphotos.org/\">In Photos dot Org</a> you&#8217;ll no doubt recognise the fatigue that comes from adjusting the publish date every single time on a new post so it appears a day later. If you have multiple posts like on a daily photoblog you have to remember what day the last post was made and adjust the date accordingly. </p>\n<p>A few years ago I wrote a small plugin that I never released to help schedule posts. In the media uploader you could select multiple photos and click a few buttons to be brought to a new page where you could enter title, content and tags for each image. Based on this experience, I suggested it as an idea to one of the teams at Automattic who built <a href=\"https://postbot.co/\">Post Bot</a>. I used that for a long time and it has its strengths. If you&#8217;re posting content that has the same or similar tags you can copy and paste the tags from one post to another. I posted lots of black and white street images from my home town this way and it was super useful! </p>\n<p>I got tired of manually typing out tags, and unfortunately the site broke a few times, with posts not scheduling or one time they scheduled all in one go. Luckily the problems were quickly fixed. However, I started using the WordPress post editor again and scheduling a bunch of photos that way.</p>\n<p>Manually editing the publish date quickly became a chore. Lazarus, the form saver Chrome extension, would sometimes popup if I didn&#8217;t click exactly on the date, or as I said before I had to remember when the last post was made. They say there&#8217;s a plugin for everything, and there is for this too. Check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-schedule/\">Publish to Schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>You tell &#8220;Publish to Schedule&#8221; which days and how many posts should be published and when you go into the post editor the next available date is picked for you! The date doesn&#8217;t change until you hit Publish but I already used it to schedule a number of posts and it works really well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/files/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-14-at-17.21.11.png\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I forgot to mention <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/daily-image/\">Daily Image</a> a new plugin by Sam Hotchkiss that does the same sort of job as Postbot but it runs on your own server. The first time you load the plugin it will show you every single unattached image in your media library which can be quite a number of images but it allows you to enter tags and quickly schedule images for posting in a simple manner.</p>\n<p>Since my focus here is on image posts I should really mention the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/lightroom/\">WordPress Export Plugin for Lightroom</a>. When installed you can create a new export target that will resize and sharpen your image and upload it to your blog, even if it&#8217;s not a WordPress.com site.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/09/07/odd-games-of-bad-company-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Odd games of bad company 2!\">Odd games of bad company 2!</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/12/28/im-on-top-of-the-world/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: I&#8217;m on top of the world\">I&#8217;m on top of the world</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/09/03/rage-quit-in-cod-4/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Rage quit in COD 4!\">Rage quit in COD 4!</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"external nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 16:50:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: GitHub Adds Plain English Explanations to License Pages for Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/github-adds-plain-english-explanations-to-license-pages-for-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2475:\"<p>GitHub took another step towards beefing up its support for open source projects this week with <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/2335-open-source-license-descriptions-and-metadata\" target=\"_blank\">a new feature that makes it easier to understand a project&#8217;s license</a>. If the project is using a popular open source license, GitHub will automatically add a short, plain-English description of the license and its permissions, conditions, and limitations. This allows GitHub users to see the implications of a project&#8217;s license at a glance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/github-license-display.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub pulls this data from <a href=\"http://ChooseALicense.com\" target=\"_blank\">ChooseALicense.com</a>, the site it created in 2013 to help developers understand and select an open source license.

The guides are a collection of 10 resources to help people get involved in open source, start their own open source projects, and manage large communities. The documents include helpful stories and tips from maintainers of successful open source projects.</p>\n<p>It was around this time last year that GitHub was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management\" target=\"_blank\">confronted by open source project maintainers with an open letter</a> of complaints regarding issue management. Nearly 2,000 maintainers signed the letter, requesting that GitHub prioritize features that open source project maintainers need. The company dragged its feet before eventually responding, while competing code hosting service GitLab capitalized on the situation with a new initiative focused on â<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938\" target=\"_blank\">making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.â Over the past year, GitHub has consistently released new features and improved existing ones in affirmation of its continued support for open source projects.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 03:03:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It â Issue 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=67590&preview=true&preview_id=67590\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5660:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Thereâs a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didnât make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Apple Pay for WooCommerce</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/03/apple-pay-woocommerce/\">announced</a> that Apple Pay is now available for stores accepting payments using Stripe. According to Marina Pape, WooCommerce is the first open source platform to integrate with Apple Pay.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Weâre also proud to be the first open source platform to integrate with Apple Pay. Open source is the default for us, but itâs exciting to continue that level of openness with such an important payment solution.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Human Made Makes Two Big Hires</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hmn.md/\">Human Made</a>, a web development agency based in the UK recently announced two big hires. The first is <a href=\"https://hmn.md/2017/03/16/mike-little-joins-human-made/\">Mike Little</a>, co-creator of the WordPress open source project, as aÂ WordPress Specialist. The second is <a href=\"https://hmn.md/2017/03/17/jenny-beaumont-joins-human-made/\">Jenny Beaumont</a>, who will take on the role of Senior Project Manager.</p>\n<h2>Editor User Experience Survey</h2>\n<p>The WordPress core development team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/03/15/editor-experience-survey/\">published a survey</a> seeking feedback and data on how people use the editor. The editor is likely the most commonly used feature in WordPress.

The post is technical in nature but provides great background information into how it works.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In improving the fidelity of search results, itâs not just a question of how we satisfy a singleÂ userâs search query, but how we satisfy thousands of users for each unique search term: which plugins will support that volume of users and their requests for support?

Burns describes the hardships encountered with her first job and how it and other circumstances led her down the path of discovering WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>By this point Iâd started playing around with WordPress, and I learned about a local meetup group. I tiptoed in one night and awkwardly introduced myself and was welcomed right in.</p>\n<p>I realized over time that this was a very different sort of group. Everyone was grassroots volunteers, putting in the effort because they wanted to learn, not because they wanted social status. There was no tiresome hierarchy, no obsession with &#8216;prestige&#8217;, no kowtowing to the person with the sexiest car (in fact, we all took the bus.) If you had a question, you could ask it without being laughed out the room. No one was obliged to give anything more than they were able to give.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>HeroPress Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href=\"http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/\">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.</p>\n<img />HeroPress Wapuu\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I present HeroPress Wapuu in celebration of HeroPress recently publishing <a href=\"https://heropress.com/heropress-at-100/\">its 100th essay. </a>If you&#8217;re a fan of HeroPress and want to see it flourish, please consider <a href=\"https://heropress.com/sponsorship/\">being a sponsor</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for issue nineteen.

The results of the short 15-question survey will assist the team in redesigning the editing experience in the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>Participants are asked to identify how they use WordPress and if they use certain features like formatting buttons and distraction-free writing. The survey also asks how easy-to-use they consider the current editor to be and how organized it is. Users are also asked if they have ever installed a plugin that adds features to the editor, presumably to determine if there are features missing that should be considered for core.</p>\n<p>One question asks participants if they use any assistive technologies along with a screen reader. WordPress Accessibility team member Amanda Rush <a href=\"https://www.customerservant.com/wordpress-editor-experience-survey/\" target=\"_blank\">published some tips for screen reader users who want to take the survey</a>. It includes several questions with radio buttons and screenshots that are not so friendly to screen readers. Rush provides a general walk-through with more explanation for those who are using screen readers to participate.</p>\n<p>So far, this survey has been more widely shared than the design team&#8217;s recent customizer survey, which was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/initial-customizer-survey-results-reveal-majority-of-respondents-dont-use-it\" target=\"_blank\">published after receiving just 50 results</a>. WordPress contributors rely heavily on these surveys to make decisions about projects they are working on, as they do not have any telemetry data about what features people are using or not using. This is one example where data could quickly demonstrate how widely the distraction-free writing mode has been adopted and show what editor formatting buttons people are using.</p>\n<p>If you have a few minutes over the weekend and want to contribute to the future of WordPress, take the <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/editor-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Experience Survey</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 21:01:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: How to View Upcoming WordCamps in the WordPress Dashboard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67572\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/how-to-view-upcoming-wordcamps-in-the-wordpress-dashboard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2067:\"<p>Over the course of a year, WordCamps take place nearly every weekend. Although you can view <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">upcoming events</a> on WordCamp Central, a relatively new plugin exist that enables you to see upcoming WordCamps on the WordPress Dashboard.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-dashboard-widget/\">WordCamp Dashboard Widget</a> developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ajitbohra/\">Ajit Bohra</a>. Once activated, a new widget appears on the dashboard that lists upcoming WordCamps. Data is retrieved by using the public <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-json/posts?type=wordcamp%29\">JSON API</a> available on WordCamp Central, is stored in a transient, and refreshed every day to reflect new data.</p>\n<img />Upcoming WordCamps Widget\n<p>Users can adjust the number of camps shown per page, sort events by location, date, or Twitter information. You can also display this information on any post or page using the [wordcamps] shortcode. The locations are linked to the event&#8217;s official WordCamp page. The @ symbol links to the official Twitter account associated with the event and the # symbol links to the official hashtag.</p>\n<p>During testing I noticed that the Twitter account for some events was either missing or incorrect. For example, WordCamp London links to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wcldn\">@wcldn</a> when it should link to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampLondon\">@WordCampLondon</a>.

Jetpack users can browse, preview, and activate themes by visiting the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/design\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com Theme Showcase</a>. WordPress.com has also added the ability for Jetpack users to upload a theme from its interface as well, a feature that targets those who are heavily using Jetpack Manage instead of the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jetpack-theme-install.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many of the free themes are already available from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/automattic/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic&#8217;s account</a> on the WordPress.org Themes Directory, but the limitations of the preview functionality doesn&#8217;t present themes in their best light. The Theme Review Team added a new rule last year that theme authors can only upload one theme at a time and will have to wait for it to pass through the queue before submitting another. This severely restricts individuals and companies that are prolific theme authors, requiring them to wait months in the queue. Authors can realistically expect to only publish one or two themes per year on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>After Zerif Lite, one of the most popular themes on WordPress.org, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue\" target=\"_blank\">suspended for five months</a> for violations of content portability requirements, Matt Mullenweg was one of the most vocal opponents of what he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue#comment-210935\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> &#8220;draconian requirements.&#8221; In 2015, Mullenweg went so far to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1432861605003292\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> that he is &#8220;completely okay with having something in the directory that breaks every guideline, as long as itâs interesting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has not made significant changes that would give authors more freedom. Instead, much of the Team&#8217;s time seems to be spent looking for ways to reduce the queue. It&#8217;s no wonder that a company like Automattic, with the infrastructure of Jetpack Manage and WordPress.com, would choose to distribute themes via a more efficient route. However, this move has left some WordPress.org theme authors wondering if WordPress.org improvements will be less of a priority in the future.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can you blame him?

It&#8217;s a calculated measure to control the on-boarding experience of new users, which WP desperately needs for continued growth amidst a field of competitors like Wix and Squarespace.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Jetpack team member Richard Muscat, WordPress.com has &#8220;no immediate plans to sell themes at this time.&#8221; Jetpack users have access to free themes but will not, in the foreseeable future, be invited to purchase WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial themes. The team also plans to continue its presence on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no plans to stop releasing themes into the .org directory,&#8221; Muscat said. &#8220;We just believe this makes an even nicer, more integrated experience for accessing the themes we offer on the WordPress.com side of things.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack&#8217;s announcement has also reignited fears of what the plugin&#8217;s commercialization might do to the WordPress ecosystem. In the past, Mullenweg has <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-powers-42-of-all-online-stores\" target=\"_blank\">identified both Jetpack and WooCommerce as &#8220;multi-billion dollar opportunities&#8221;</a> that could each individually be larger than WordPress.com. If WordPress.org is failing to attract new users with its theme previews, then Jetpack/WordPress.com is likely to pull even more eyes away with its separate marketplace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a small business (a label that&#8217;s critical) product creator, I see this as a motion in the direction to increase the visibility of Jetpack&#8217;s free/paid feature set, above the rest of us trying to desperately make a living out here,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;Jetpack will be marketed as the one-stop-solution for all of your small business website needs, if that hasn&#8217;t already been woven into the fabric of it&#8217;s current messaging. It is ultimately positioning itself as the trusted source of functionality for new users, versus us &#8216;third-party&#8217; plugins. After all, who wouldn&#8217;t trust the company &#8216;behind WordPress?\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ionut Neagu, CEO at <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Themeisle.com</a>, and the author of Zerif Lite, shares Medeiros&#8217; concerns about Jetpack&#8217;s more recent commercialization efforts.</p>\n<p>âWhat worries me more is the speed at which Automattic is pushing Jetpack,&#8221; Neagu said. &#8220;The Personal plan was introduced, and yesterday I got a cold email from some company they work with promoting their affiliate program. Today themes were introduced. It makes me wonder how far they plan to go and how this will affect theme and plugin developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Neagu takes a more optimistic stance on self-hosted users installing themes from WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a theme author, I am not that worried about this particular aspect. Right now those themes are quite hard to find (it took me 10 minutes), are more targeted towards people using Jetpack Manage, and as far as I can see lots of them are looking a bit outdated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Neagu sees a disconnect between what WordPress.org thinks users want and what they are actually looking for. Based on his research and experience selling themes, Neagu has found that users still expect complete solutions from themes. WordPress has grown beyond being just a blogging platform. Neagu said he hopes WordPress.org&#8217;s research for the new editor will reveal how many people are actually using the software for business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We run a themes directory as well and we did extensive heatmaps to understand what kind of themes/screenshots users click on/ like,&#8221; Neagu said. &#8220;Looking at the results of a &#8216;business&#8217; query, I am quite sure that users wonât be excited.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/business-themes.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This is likely the first iteration, and data from more Jetpack users should help WordPress.com refine the queries to present a mix of newer and popular themes. At the moment it looks to be simply a way to offer all of their available themes without the red tape of WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Addresses Confusion Over WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guideline Regarding Executable Code and Installs</h3>\n<p>The news of WordPress.com installing and updating themes for Jetpack users gave rise to speculation about whether or not this move is a violation of the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin directory guidelines</a>. Discussions centered around guideline #8, which states that plugins may not send executable code via third-party systems:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Serving updates or otherwise installing plugins, themes, or add-ons from servers other than WordPress.orgâs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jetpack representative Richard Muscat gave us the following statement on behalf of Automattic:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The guidelines prohibit _plugins_ from installing third party code directly but Jetpack doesnât do that for this feature. The guidelines state that: âExecuting outside code within a plugin *when not acting as a service* is not allowed.â</p>\n<p>The service Jetpack provides with respect to themes is via WordPress.com which _is_ acting as a service. This is identical to how Akismet operates with respect to spam-filtering and other Jetpack services such as data sync and backup, content delivery (Photon), and plugin installation/updates.</p>\n<p>We ask users to opt-in to WordPress.com services when connecting Jetpack and all our services follow established guidelines.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The public discussions also prompted WordPress.org Plugin Directory representatives to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/03/16/clarification-of-guideline-8-executable-code-and-installs/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> an article clarifying that Jetpack is not in violation for installing themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The trick here, and this is what is about to sound like hair splitting, is that itâs not the plugin UI on your site that does the install,&#8221; Mika Epstein said. &#8220;In order for Manage WP and Jetpack to work, you have to go to your panel on their sites and install the items.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As SaaS products have not yet been used extensively in the WordPress ecosystem, developers are still figuring out how this type of implementation can interact with WordPress sites via plugins installed from the official directory. The plugin team clarified that if you are pushing plugin or theme installs or updates from a third-party service on its website, then it is no longer a third-party service but rather a first-party service where you are directly initiating those actions.</p>\n<p>However, not all developers agree that this distinction makes any difference.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628\">@daljo628</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJeffMatson\">@thejeffmatson</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/williamsba\">@williamsba</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriswallace\">@chriswallace</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros\">@mattmedeiros</a> Saying SaaS can install plugins but plugin cannot install plugins is silly.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"ð\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@carlhancock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/842485294863712256\">March 16, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gravity Forms founder Carl Hancock contends that ManageWP is different in that it doesn&#8217;t provide users with themes and plugins &#8211; it&#8217;s just a service for managing your sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can install plugins from the WordPress.org plugin and theme repository, you can connect your Dropbox account and install plugins from your Dropbox account, or you can upload your own plugins,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;The key is itâs either plugins and themes from WordPress.org OR bring your own. Just like WordPress itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They [ManageWP] do not provide an alternative repository of themes and/or plugins that competes with the WordPress.org repos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is where much of the controversy lies for WordPress.org theme authors who depend on the official directory for distribution. Competing with equally free themes that are hosted on WordPress.com with a much better sorting UI and preview functionality is a new challenge they will have to embrace.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:08:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"WPTavern: U.S. Department of Defense Launches Code.mil Open Source Initiative, First Release Tests Impact of AGPL Licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=67451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"https://wptavern.com/u-s-department-of-defense-launches-code-mil-open-source-initiative-first-release-tests-impact-of-agpl-licensing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7190:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/department-of-defense.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>A U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft flies over northern Iraq Sept. 23, 2014, after conducting airstrikes in Syria. &#8211; photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/39955793@N07/15172530147/\">U.S. Department of Defense</a>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source\" target=\"_blank\">experimenting with open sourcing more of its code</a> on GitHub. <a href=\"http://Code.mil\" target=\"_blank\">Code.mil</a> invites developers from around the world to collaborate with federal employees on unclassified code. The Defense Digital Service (DDS), which brings in experts from top technology companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix for short assignments, is organizing the initiative to open source more government code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Open source and free software (which refers to software freedom, not free of cost) are industry best practices and integral parts of modern software development,&#8221; the department said in a <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/1092364/dod-announces-the-launch-of-codemil-an-experiment-in-open-source\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> announcing the initiative. &#8220;They, however, are concepts yet to be widely adopted within the department. With Code.mil, DoD can access a depth and breadth of technical skill previously underutilized while offering software tools created by the government for free public use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The FAQ document for the initiative states that &#8220;modern software is open sourced software&#8221; and that the department is aiming to more actively participate in the open source and free software communities.</p>\n<p>Licensing is one of the unique challenges of making government code open source, as code written by federal employees is not protected by copyright under U.S. laws. After consulting the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation, the DoD devised an open source licensing strategy where code written by federal employees will fall under the public domain with no restrictions. DDS developed a GitHub webhook to ensure commits from government employees follow the <a href=\"https://developercertificate.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Developer Certificate of Origin</a> process. Private sector contributions will be protected by standard OSS licenses. This is outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/blob/master/Proposal/INTENT.md\" target=\"_blank\">INTENT.md</a> document on the Code.mil repository.</p>\n<h3>Code.mil&#8217;s First Open Source Project Released Under AGPL to &#8220;Test GPL as an Approach&#8221;</h3>\n<p>In addressing one person&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/issues/19#issuecomment-282333798\" target=\"_blank\">feedback</a> advocating for all Code.mil projects to be MIT-licensed, DDS engineer Tom Bereknyei confirmed that the team will leave this decision to each project&#8217;s leadership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had these same discussions internally,&#8221; Bereknyei said. &#8220;We did not want to endorse a particular license and we intend each project to decide which license is appropriate for them. Some may choose MIT, BSD, Apache, or eventually GPL. We did not want to take that choice away from them.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/eMCM\" target=\"_blank\">eMCM</a>, a web-based viewer for the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), is the first open source project to be released on Code.mil. It provides a canonical &#8220;live&#8221; edition of the manual that is easier to access and maintain than previous versions. eMCM was released this week under the AGPL license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose to use the Affero General Public License (AGPL) for the eMCM because every military member has the right to know how the raw legal code (i.e., MCM) will be transformed or manipulated by the eMCM,&#8221; the Defense Digital Service stated in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@DefenseDigitalService/code-mil-an-open-source-initiative-at-the-pentagon-5ae4986b79bc#.f9bw1s2ha\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;Applying the AGPL is a small but important way to help ensure the public has that freedom and transparency to the process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the pull-request for <a href=\"https://github.com/deptofdefense/eMCM/pull/5\" target=\"_blank\">updating the license on the project</a>, Bereknyei explained why he proposed the AGPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a user-facing project, not a library. Ultimately it would be good to preserve the rights of the public to inspect how the raw MCM is transformed by the viewer.</p>\n<p>Among the projects we have, this seems to be the best candidate for a GPL test. It is fairly self contained, doesn&#8217;t integrate with any systems, front-end heavy, small enough that a corporate rewrite is easy, and uses only a few libraries. My goal is only to test GPL as an approach. If this project isn&#8217;t suited, I&#8217;m sure we can find another.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When Bereknyei was questioned by DDS colleague Nicholas Small about why he opted for AGPL over MIT, he said he wanted to protect the code from being redistributed as closed-source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;MIT would allow someone to fork, improve, and release closed-source,&#8221; Bereknyei said. &#8220;The rule of thumb I am trying to apply is that when the rights/convenience for developers are more important, go with MIT/BSD/ISC. When the rights/convenience for users are more important, go with GPL.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Historically, the DoD has <a href=\"http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_When_a_DoD_contractor_is_developing_a_new_system.2Fsoftware_as_a_deliverable_in_a_typical_DoD_contract.2C_is_it_possible_to_use_existing_software_licensed_using_the_GNU_General_Public_License_.28GPL.29.3F_Can_the_DoD_used_GPL-licensed_software.3F\" target=\"_blank\">used GPL-licensed software extensively</a> and even <a href=\"http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_What_license_should_the_government_or_contractor_choose.2Fselect_when_releasing_open_source_software.3F\" target=\"_blank\">recommends government contractors select a GPL-compatible license</a> when developing software as a deliverable in DoD contracts.</p>\n<p>One beneficial byproduct of the DoD&#8217;s initiative to open source more code is that the public can watch and participate as federal employees discuss license selection in the open. The department is finally recognizing that taxpayer-funded code is a public good and inviting private sector professionals to the table to build modern software together. Anyone can open an issue or pull request, regardless of their background, location, or formal qualifications.

My poor parents had to stay focused on avoiding all of the insane cross-country drivers and traffic from most people\'s nightmares. Meanwhile my brother, sister and I entertained each otherÂ by converting the back seat of our green Plymouth Voyager into a UFC fighting ring. It was never easy for my parents on tripsÂ and it made me feel like there was no way of traveling without stress. This isn\'t a post about traveling anywhere you want in the world with young kids. Even though I\'m not a parent, I\'d imagine that there would be a challenge to that no matter what \"life hack\" you have working for you. This is post about getting over a few hurdles that are holding people back from doing, creating, and discovering new and incredible weekends, and adding 2,496 hours of vacation time to your year.</p><p>Â </p><p>\"I feel like going on a road trip but I don\'t know when we would go or where\" My friend Robby said over a basket of boneless garlic parmesan wings. \"What if we went to Mount Rushmore? It\'s only 6 hours away from Denver, and a friend of mine tells me it\'s a pretty cool road trip.\"Â </p><p>None of us had any vacation time, and since it was already October we were running out of opportunities for snow-free driving. If we wanted to do it that year we were going to need to get on it, and make it happen.Â </p><p>\"What if we went this weekend?\" I said half-jokingly.</p><p>That\'s all it took.</p><p>We left Saturday Morning and got back Sunday night. I got to see Mount Rushmore, and the (still uncompleted) Crazy Horse monument all over a short period of time that would have normallyÂ consisted of me binge watching Netflix in my underwear.</p><p>Since then I\'ve never been afraid to saying yes to the idea of a two-day adventure, and no to all of the things I would normally do over a weekend. This year we did a trip to the Grand Canyon from Colorado Springs Colorado.</p><p>2 day weekend + 24 hours of driving + awesome landmarks + friends + snacks = an experience I\'m glad I was willing to go after.</p><p>I emerged on the other side of this journey with some great pictures, a few stories, and a few little bits that I will chew on the next time I evaluate whether or not to do something like similarÂ in the future. Iâll throw these out to you to consider the next time you have a weekend, a few friends and a destination in mind. If youâre a parent Iâm sorry if this post doesnât help you make road tripping easier, but perhaps you will findÂ some other valueÂ in here that can add to your next road trip.</p><p>Here are a few stories people tell themselves:</p><ul><li>Planning a trip is difficult</li><li>Why would I go somewhere just to turn around and come back</li><li>It\'s going to feel like I didn\'t even get a weekend</li><li>I only have two days</li><li>I don\'t have the money for that</li></ul><p>Â </p><h3>When is the last time you had something other than \"good\" to say in response to the question \"how was your weekend?\" Â </h3><h3>It\'s time to go do that thing you\'ve always wanted to do but \"never had the time for.\"</h3><p>Agenda\'s for the most part are useless for this kind of experience. Part of unlocking these two days will require accepting the events as they come, and embracing them as part of the story.Â </p><div>We didnât have an agenda or a schedule setup to make this trip happen but if we did it would look something like this:</div><div>Â </div><ul><li>10:30pm Thursday Night - Meet roommate at Walmart to gather snacks</li><li>11:00pm Thursday Night - leave for AZ</li><li>2:00 am Friday Morning - Arrive in Gunnison Colorado to Pick up my girlfriend</li><li>11:00am Friday Morning - Arrive at Grand Canyon National Park</li><li>Friday during the day - Frolic around and enjoy the wonders of the Grand Canyon</li><li>Friday night - Stay at hotel in Flagstaff</li><li>8:00 am Saturday Morning - Head home</li><li>9:00pm Saturday Night - Arrive at home</li></ul><div>Â </div><div>Of course even though that was the idea, the actual trip ended up like this:</div><div>Â </div><ul><li>10:30pm Thursday Night - Meet roommate at Walmart to gather snacks</li><li>11:00pm Thursday Night- Roommate doesnât feel well and isnât sure he is going to be able to boot and rally</li><li>12:00amÂ Friday Morning - leave for AZ</li><li>12:15am Friday Morning - Stop at Taco Bueno for their awesome 60 Cent taco deal</li><li>1:00am Friday Morning - Finally on the road</li><li>4:00 am Friday Morning - Arrive in Gunnison Colorado to Pick up my girlfriend</li><li>6:30 am Friday Morning- Stop and get pictures of the sunrise over the beautiful colors of the aspens.</li><li>12:30pm Friday Afternoon- Stop at four corners (another monument Iâve wanted to visit.</li><li>3:00 pm Friday Afternoon - Arrive at Grand Canyon National Park</li><li>Friday for the remaining day- Enjoy the grand canyon, get pictures go to the gift shop and then head out for flagstaff.</li><li>Friday night - Go out on the town and stop at a dairy queen, then go to see the Martian, then stay at hotel in Flagstaff.</li><li>8:00 am - Grab coffee with a friend who attends college in Flagstaff</li><li>11:00 am Saturday Morning - Eat breakfast at an awesome diner</li><li>12:30pm Saturday afternoon- head home</li><li>2:00am Sunday morning - Arrive at home</li></ul><div>Â </div><div>Everybody knows that trips never go the way you think they are going to go, but thatâs not whatâs important. What is important is recognizing that no matter what happens during the journey itâs up to you to accept everything thatâs out of your control as the current reality, and focus your attention on all of the incredible upsides to the places you are experiencing and conversations you are having.</div><div>Â </div><div>In order to make this trip happen I needed to live withÂ two ideas:</div><div>Â </div><ol><li><h2><strong>I can live with less sleep for a few days</strong></h2></li><li><h2><strong>The joy from traveling has less to do with the destination and more to do with the journey to the destination</strong></h2></li></ol><div>Â </div><div>I recognize that lack of sleep and sitting in a car for 24 hours is tough, but sitting at the end of my life thinking about all of the things I wish I could do is a lot harder. The trip to the Grand Canyon was a lot of fun and offered some incredible scenery, conversations and experiences. I realize now that this trip opened my mind up to a new realm of possibility. For most people, itâs un-thinkable to donate the few days you have free from commitments to creating an experience that will last your lifetime. You may not be able to change the things you are committed to during your work week, but you do have the ability to change your thought process about what you can accomplish over a two day break. With this new level of thinking I look at my weekends in a whole new light. Instead of âchilling outâ watching Netflix, and dreading Monday morning, I see a chance to do something crazy. I can build something, go somewhere, learn, write, and explore.</div><div>Â </div><h2><strong>All of these things are available for you too.</strong></h2><div>Â </div><div>I offer a simple challenge: Take a look at what youâve done for the last 5 weekends. Now design a weekend that is completely different from the average of your 5 past weekends. In this way you can come away from the weekend with a new outlook on life, and greet your Monday morning with stories about a weekend you dared to create.</div><div>Â </div><h2><strong>Here are 5 simple rules to follow to createÂ memorable weekendÂ experiences:</strong></h2><div>Â </div><div><strong>Pick a destination -Â </strong>Choose a place that\'s outside of your comfort zone. a place that takes twice as long to get to as the usual place you might visit over a weekend.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Go with friends-Â </strong>Find a few people you love spending time with who will go with you on this incredible journey. Make sure that these are people you get along with well. If you get 4 people together and are willing to share, the cost of a hotel room becomes a whole lot less.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Don\'t plan too much-Â </strong>Stuff happens, and there isn\'t anything we can do about most of it. During a trip like this you must be willing to not take things to seriously and do your absolute best to focus your energy on only that which you can actually control.Â </div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Be prepared to not sleep-Â </strong>Sleep as much as you can leading up to the trip, but recognize that in order to add some hours to your life you have to be willing to trade some of your time. You may not need to do this for closer locations, but anything over 8 hours away starts to wear on you. ( Having friends with you also helps here because they can take on some of the driving.)</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Pretend like you are leaving the day before you actually are - </strong>This seems really obvious but it\'s amazing how much better my adventures go if I pretend like I\'m leaving the day before. Having a list helps with packing, but it\'s nice to not have the weight of hurrying to get ready to leave. No one wants to be the person that holds up the group.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Bonus! See the beauty in everything -</strong> Focus on the beauty all around you. You may not live where there are lots of pretty things to visit fairly close by, but I\'m sure there is somewhere that is different from what you are used to. Go find that place and look for the beauty that exists there. I know you can do it!</div><div>Â </div><div>Â </div>\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:11:\"panels_info\";a:5:{s:5:\"class\";s:31:\"SiteOrigin_Widget_Editor_Widget\";s:3:\"raw\";b:0;s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:4:\"cell\";i:0;s:2:\"id\";i:0;}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:11:\"panels_info\";a:4:{s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:4:\"cell\";i:1;s:2:\"id\";i:1;}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:1;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}i:1;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:2;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}i:2;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:2;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:5:{i:0;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:0;s:6:\"weight\";i:1;}i:1;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.6180339920920573;}i:2;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.3819660079079427;}i:3;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:2;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.3819660079079427;}i:4;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:2;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.6180339920920573;}}}'),(152,597,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:1;}'),(153,597,'_edit_last','2'),(154,597,'_wp_page_template','default'),(155,597,'xyz_fbap','1'),(156,597,'_yoast_wpseo_content_score','30'),(157,97,'_edit_last','2'),(158,97,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(159,97,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(160,97,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(161,97,'wpb_post_views_count','0'),(162,97,'_s2mail','yes'),(163,97,'dsq_thread_id','3098402206'),(164,97,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(165,98,'_edit_last','2'),(166,98,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(167,98,'wpb_post_views_count','17'),(168,98,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(169,98,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(170,98,'dsq_thread_id','3137196040'),(171,98,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(172,320,'_edit_last','2'),(173,320,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(174,320,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(175,320,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(176,320,'_s2mail','yes'),(177,320,'_yoast_wpseo_opengraph-image','http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/book-decisive-265x440.png'),(178,320,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:31;}'),(179,329,'_edit_last','2'),(180,329,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(181,329,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(182,329,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(183,329,'_s2mail','yes'),(184,329,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:11;}'),(185,337,'_edit_last','2'),(186,337,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(187,337,'panels_data','a:3:{s:7:\"widgets\";a:2:{i:0;a:3:{s:3:\"src\";s:64:\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\";s:4:\"href\";s:64:\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:31:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widgets_Image\";}}i:1;a:4:{s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"text\";s:606:\"<h3>Goals.

If I didnât bring it up, you most likely wouldnât be considering the miracle that the electrical pulses in my head were converted into words, sent to my fingertips, converted into electrical signals sent to the computer through an infinitely complex set of protocols and mediums, then re-converted again to text and mapped out onto the millions of tiny lights on your monitor. You may also feel compelled to read this post for one reason or another, and right now Iâd like to ask you to consider moving on to the next post, or thing you have as an option in front of you. By choosing something other than what you see as your âcurrent activityâ, especially if it is something really ludicrous you have effectively <b>destroyed your frame</b>.</p><p>The frame is a helpful tool for recognizing the subconscious assumptions you make about every single aspect of your life. By recognizing the frame, you are shedding light on line that all opportunity stands behind, gazing longingly in at the fluff lucky enough to make it into the limelight. That fluff is inside of your frame for one simple reason. You want it there. It is the thing or things that resonated with your emotions causing you to quickly form the assumption that it deserves your attention. It is the fluff that makes a decision difficult. It is time to wake up to the reality. Outside of the small canvas of options you have painted within the frame of your decision, lies a gallery rife with even better options that werenât even allowed onto your paint brush. Destroy your frame. Tear it off of the wall and embrace the world of possibilities that lie in front of you. Unplug from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwq7b2i-vc\">the Matrix</a> youâve created for yourself and see whatâs really available for you. Time is of the essence, so now that youâve emerged on the other side, take a deep breath. Letâs make a decision.</p><h5>It starts with the change agent. A problem that needs solving.</h5><p>A person came into a computer shop I worked at and asked the question: âShould I buy a Mac? I hear they are a lot easier to use and my PC has been running so slow.â What is this personâs problem? What change agent caused them to start a decision process in the first place?</p><p>That is when the Apple elitist in me screams: âDuh, theyâre on a freaking PC, of course itâs slow and frustrating!â. Ladies and Gentleman I present in all of its narrow minded glory, a frame. You may not see the danger, but imagine me giving that person information based on what my frame of their problem says the obvious choice is. Itâs just plain foolish to set one option on a scale without a counter option to balance it out and come to a reasonable, educated decision. Itâs time to destroy the frame and rebuild it around options that matter. Here is how we do it:</p><h3><strong>Ask off the wall questions-</strong></h3><p>How educated is she when it comes to PC? How long has she had her PC? Could she do more of the things that she finds frustrating on the PC in a more familiar environment? Does she have any friends that she can borrow a Mac from to ensure that she isnât switching to something that will have a learning curve? How do they like living in Colorado? What is their favorite television show?What is the price difference between a low end Mac and a high end PC? You get the picture. Make cases for both sides of the argument. Pose as many questions as possible and donât be afraid of the questions that donât seem to have any relation to the problem.</p><h3><strong>Trash the options your frame dealt you-</strong></h3><p>In most cases while confronting a decision, our frame usually submits a few ideas for consideration. Throw them out of the equation all together. This leaves you with one problem and zero solutions. Innovate. If that option wasnât available how then could we solve the problem. Switching to Mac isnât an option, and this person desperately needs to feel less frustrated when using a PC. What about switching to Linux? Or not using a computer at all? It seems that innovation is usually brought into existence because it is demanded. Demand innovation. Paint the frame, then the gallery, then demolish the gallery, and force yourself to migrate your art onto the hull of a spaceship.</p><h3><strong>Consider the opportunity cost-</strong></h3><p>If one of their options is to spend a minimum of $700 on a Mac, could that money be used to solve the problem using a different option? Â What is the opportunity cost of all of your options. What opportunity are you giving up to make the current option you are considering?</p><p>Now assess the options. Borrow Mac from a friend and evaluate it for 10 dayâs. Become more familiar with working in a PC environment(unfortunately this does mean learning a thing or two about basic maintenance). Start working through options to ease into the decision. Try the cheapest options first and consider setting a timeline that tells you when you will take the plunge.</p><p>Now build a new frame, the proper frame your new set of options deserve.Start to strategically migrate the options that seem least likely to solve the original problem to the outside, and sit back and appreciate the different features of each option you now have in front of you.</p><p>Left with a handful of reasonable options, including ones that you may have never considered, it is time to decide.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p><strong>Framing is usually done without unconsciously, which means it relies on our deeper self, and does not provide a platform for our better options to breathe. We must destroy that frame and rebuild it around a set of options that includes the options that fell into the crowd of ideas that got instantly shoved aside when the problem presented itself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ask any question that pops into your head to try and get some off the wall ideas and solutions for handling the problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Take the obvious solution out of the picture all together and ask a new question such as: â If solution x canât happen, what can I do instead to solve problem y?â</strong></p><p><strong>Consider the opportunity cost: âWhat value would one decision give that another one wouldnât?â</strong></p><h4>BONUS: How does this apply to the educational system?</h4><p>Frame: Students must be tested and graded in order to ensure that they are learning, and that our teachers are doing their jobs.</p><p>What problem is this solving? We donât know if kids are learning, and if the teacher is doing their job.</p><h4>Off the wall questions-</h4><p>Who is the educational system for, the kids or the administrative board?</p><p>Why are schools all inside?</p><p>Why does every kid need to go to school?</p><p>What are they really getting from it?</p><p>What does the grading system measure?</p><p>Who benefits most from the grading system?</p><h4>Remove the current solution all together-</h4><p>In a school with no grading system how would teachers know that their students understand the material?</p><p>Give smaller tests on each subject and find out where kids are struggling and frame their concepts differently so they might have a better chance to understand the material.</p><p>Allow kids to work at their own pace and put more emphasis on challenging them to try new things.</p><h4>Opportunity Cost-</h4><p>What could the money that goes into testing and grading be used for?</p><p>It is estimated that 1.7 billion dollars is spent on testing every year which could easily be used to implement better programs that support learning.</p><p>By not grading, the teachers have more time to spend working with kids ensuring that they donât need help understanding the various concepts.</p><p>To read more about this issue be sure to check out my friend <a href=\"https://altmba.com/sethperler/how-to-make-good-decisions-about-standardized-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sethâs post</a>.</p><hr /><p><i>About this project: This is post 2/5 on Project 1 of altMBA.

It\'s been awesome to hear all of the great feedback! I think that one of the most common critiques was on the weakness of the article towards the end. I think that there are three ways to approach an issue of lack luster content.</p><p>1. When you start to feel like the content you are producing is weak and not enjoyable to write, scrap it and move on to something that is.</p><p>2.Read each sentence carefully to find out which sentence is the most boring, then ditch those select sentences.</p><p>3.Re-read the paper as Ryon mentioned and come up with an idea of how it sounds.</p><p>I\'ve also concluded that the bonus section couldÂ either be done away with, setup as an additional example, or moved into a separate post.</p><p>If I were to re-write this post, I would condense it by chopping out my own fluff that I felt like I needed to satisfy the project. What I have to say is only important if people are awake long enough to read it.</p><p>In order to practice what I preach starting now:</p><p>That\'s it.

You donât seem to really like it at all. Your friends see it. People you work with see it. The people you save when you are living in your callingÂ see it too. Why canât you embrace it? What worldly threat is holding you back from living as superman all of the time?</p><h6>To be Clark Kent and brush your calling to the side, is to deny yourself time spent operating as the creature you were intended to be.</h6><p>It is time to sell the bullshit you bought, and start to work with what you were given. Youâve got no time to lose! Imagine a life where you wake up excited for the day and you have trouble going to sleep because your day was filled to the brim with people and experiences worth having again, and again. What does your day look like?</p><p>Hurrah! If you can search inside yourself and identify the answer, congratulations! Youâve now fertilized the catalyst of a very long journey ahead. It is going to be a very challenging several months, and there will be plenty of complications. However, it will pay off. Your body now roams the planet conscious of its one purpose: Deliver this beautiful, previously unknown part of myself into the world, and walk with it through its incredible life ahead.</p><h4><strong>Set your goals.</strong></h4><p><strong>Conceive the dream.</strong> Carry it through its development. Release it into the world kicking, screaming, and smashing through the barriers that were put in place before its conception.</p><p><strong>What do those barriers look like?</strong></p><p><strong>What must you learn along the way?</strong></p><p><strong>Who needs to be apart of your support circle?</strong></p><p>Finally, <strong>set its due date!</strong> You are an excited new parent and canât wait to meet your child.</p><p>Rejoice when it comes to fruition, breathes the air of the earth and can be remarked on by others fortunate enough to meet it.</p><p>My name is Nic Bovee. I dream of a life spent helping entities bigger than myself with a team of people who always challenge the status quo. My goal is to rely less on my position as Clark Kent, and dare to fly into the unknown as the super hero I was placed on earth to be. I love being asked questions I donât know the answer to. I love to collaborate with a team of people who enjoy the same. It would be so refreshing to operate with a team of âA+â players who donât allow me to stay tucked away in the safe bowels of my comfort zone. The path to living my dream comes with many adversaries. The biggest challenge being the mentality I have created for myself.</p><p>â You cannot survive on your own!â</p><p>âYouâre not smart enough! â</p><p>âYou depend on other people to live! â</p><p>Pushing against those barriers until my newly achieved goal can break through them is going to be almost impossible. Itâs going to take a lifestyle that permits learning, and developing new things while still functioning safely in the company. It will take me stepping out and assembling a team of people who are the best in the world at what they do. It will take my vulnerability to step out and actively look for the bigger entities that have problems that our elite team can solve for them.</p><p>My plan of action is this.</p><p>Start now. Reach out to the people in my existing circle and find out if they want to be apart of something like this. Start acting like a company, and set deadlines for the projects Iâm already involved in. Learn how to pay taxes like a company. Tune in to what it is I actually do on the team, and pitch it to the people who I want to work with.</p><p><strong>My Deadline</strong></p><p>June 15<sup>th</sup> 2016-It is the one-year anniversary of the day I started the most important transformation of my life. I will be spending an equal portion of my time during the week meeting with my team and talking through the current challenges our firm faces. My price structure will be fully developed as a piece of art. I will have at minimum 5 projects at a time, and will be actively networking to gain at least 5 more for the next month. We will ship on time. We will ship great work. I will have learned new things from the 50+ books I add to my library. Most importantly, I will be shedding new light on my current job and hopefully applying some of the concepts from my company into the weaknesses of the one I work for. Itâs not going to be easy, and Iâll need to constantly monitor the course and change as need be.</p><p>Creating all of this will be worth it. When I reach the top I will have brought along stories that either tell of the bounty of success or the lessons from a successful failure.</p><h3><strong>P.S.</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of my article, I was really leaving an opening or invitation for readers to join in and set some goals of their own. I left the door open, but never told anyone to go in. As <strong><a href=\"https://altmba.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=post&amp;author=133\">Seth Perler</a></strong> pointed out, I should make a point of letting the reader know that there is an opportunity and to get the most out of my article they should take it.</p><h4><strong>Updated Plan of action- Upon Michelleâs request</strong></h4><p><strong>Restate my goal (With meat):</strong></p><p>I want to live a life where I work with companies that want to push themselves to a new level of greatness by helping them make decisions on the creative front. This includes:</p><p><strong>Branding</strong>- Designing the story behind the image, then updating the image to reflect the story. I want to design a workflow that will ask the questions that need to be asked in order to discover what the companyâs story is.</p><p><strong>Logo Design</strong>- Whether itâs a redesign for branding or a start to finish creation, my goal is to be a company that takes the culture of a company, and creates a logo for them. Iâve done this for a few different people, and Iâve really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Web Site Design</strong>- This is definitely an element of my structure that will require looking for a great developer who can work with me on developing a strategic method of laying out a site in order to provide an easy experience that doesnât feel âbrokenâ.</p><p><strong>Customer Relationship Design</strong>- Most small companies I talk to donât care about the actual relationship that they have with their customers. It sucks because they miss out on such an awesome opportunity to make the customer want to keep coming back for more than just the product that they sell.</p><p><strong>Customer Experience Design</strong>- From start to finish, I want to build the street that a customer walks down when they use that company. This has a lot to do with Sethâs Purple Cow concept, as well as tribes. It think that most companies leave the community out of it. What needs to happen is a new focus on doing things that wow the customer. Zappos had free 2 day shipping as something they did to upgrade the customerâs order from free standard shipping. Sweetwater sends smarties with musical widget they send. I want to evaluate the customer experience by having people go through the entire interaction with the company, and come up with a list of things the loved and things they disliked.</p><p><strong>Value Development</strong>- Work on actual projects the customer is working on to offer insight on how they can add even more value to what they are offering by means of adding a few features, or simply revising the way they pitch the product. This process will rely heavily on the information we have from the strong customer relationships and using it to offer something that speaks to them.</p><p><strong>Company Structure Design</strong>- This first came from an experience I had as general manager of a computer shop. This involves looking at the internal workflow. I want to look at what the business does internally and help them find a better way to accomplish more things, faster! I think that itâs difficult to see the inefficiency if you are used to looking at it every day. We come in and identify the top things that could change in one week that would help a company be more efficient in the way that it runs and handles itself.</p><h4><strong>Pushing against the obstacles</strong></h4><p><strong>Who will I reach out to?</strong></p><p>Two groups of people</p><p><strong>Internal</strong>- People I know personally who would be a lot of help and want to be a part of this company or know people who might. The smaller goal here is to build a team of people that expand the diversity of the promises we can make to our customers. By knowing the people apart of this, we can make promises and exceed them to provide our customers with an exceptional experience</p><p>People from internal are filling certain roles of the kind of experience our group wants to create:</p><p>WebÂ Â Â Â Â  MarketingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Internal StructureÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  EducationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DevelopersÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Graphics Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â BrandingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Value Development</p><p>Jon Dale- Close personal friend and the reason Iâm aware of Seth Godin and in the altMBA</p><p>Todd A. - Web</p><p>Justin L. - Social Marketing</p><p>Andy T. â Develop the network</p><p>Josh K. â Learning materials</p><p>Kevin M. â Becoming an entrepreneur vs. a free lancer</p><p>Stephen D. â Developer connections</p><p>Jason R. â Developer connections</p><p>Brooke B. â Marketing</p><p><strong>External</strong>- Companies that have people in them who want to make the company more than just a Car dealership. More than just a coffee shop. More than an okay place to go buy jewelry. Places that are used to dealing with pricy corporate establishments that use the same methods they have used for the last 20 years to offer a solution of one facet of the customers problem. I want to start small with people I have already worked with and know, offering new value that their company can begin to implement, until I have a method I can start to practice on a bigger company.</p><p>The PC Shop</p><p>G1 Equip</p><p>MakeExerciseEasy</p><p>Recycles</p><p>DTG</p><p>CreativeIvoryMusic</p><p>Moutain Scoops</p><p>Team TeleCycle</p><p>Jives</p><h4>Why will they want to be a part of what Iâm doing?</h4><p><strong>Internal</strong>- Not all of them will be a part of it directly, but they may point me in the direction of people who will want to be part of it directly. I think that if I am connected with the right people, the idea of scheduling time to collaborate and sharing contracts with people who are the best at what they do will be an attractive offer for people who may be wasting their time at a job they get nothing from.</p><p><strong>External-</strong>I believe that when presented with an opportunity to invigorate the working environment and increase their exposure to people who care, as well as overall productivity and financial performance. I see it as them making the decision to hire a life coach that helps the company find what it wants just as much as it helps the employees.</p><h4><strong>What will I ask specifically?</strong></h4><p>Internal- Why do you do what you do? If their passionate I want to connect them with the companies that are passionate.</p><h4><strong>What is the project they are actually joining?</strong></h4><p>That varies based on the client. Some of my clients have wanted minimal changes to be made on one page of their site. Others have had me re design their logo and analyze their business structure.</p><h4>How will I specifically act like a company?</h4><p>Stephen Pressfield brought up the idea of meeting with yourself weekly. Thanks Stephen! I want to meet on a week by week basis and set goals for my âCompanyâ as if I already had the accountability of people who were waiting for me to give them a project to do.Â  I also want to spend time developing my whole business model, to understand what kind of company it is that Iâm really describing.</p><h4><strong>List the projects that need deadlines.</strong></h4><p>Current projects that need deadlines are all web based projects. I am rotten liar to myself. I tell myself that I donât have time to spend on the project. Wrong. I will start by setting a dead line to have a fully written Web Design questionnaire by next Wednesday.</p><h4><strong>How will I learn to pay taxes like a company?</strong></h4><p>This is one that Iâm hoping I can find info on from my cohort or the altMBA family. I think it will be quite a while before I can hire a book keeper or CPA. What book can I read that will teach me how to manage an LLC in terms of taxes, and not get screwed over.</p><h4><strong>What is that you want to do? How will you pitch it?</strong></h4><p>Iâm passionate about many things, but there are two things that out-weigh the rest. Design, and people.</p><p>I love to see and understand why things were created the way they were. When I can afford to do it without debt, I will go to college for design both industrial, and graphic. The thing that I really love looking at is details, and in this job I get to explore details in almost every aspect of my favorite hobby: business. I also love people. I want to create something that is as much a community as it is a company. A place for creatives. These creatives might be paying the community, or they might be getting paid. We all are passionate about building plan Z first and shipping a day early than we were expected.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"3\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:4:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}i:2;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:3;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:5:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:18:\"0.4996331621423331\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:18:\"0.5003668378576669\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:3;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"2\";}i:4;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"3\";}}}'),(243,395,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(244,395,'_s2mail','yes'),(245,395,'_yoast_wpseo_title','Superman-Nic Bovee'),(246,395,'_oembed_67632d3d1981e5b31d3792bb5ac27005','<iframe width=\"654\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3SVDJRBSyM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>'),(247,395,'_oembed_time_67632d3d1981e5b31d3792bb5ac27005','1437350665'),(248,395,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(249,395,'_oembed_e188de234fc87251053f9de452828296','{{unknown}}'),(250,399,'_edit_last','2'),(251,399,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(252,399,'panels_data','a:3:{s:7:\"widgets\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:\"video\";s:27:\"http://youtu.be/0bZCjIVlx4g\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widgets_EmbeddedVideo\";}}i:1;a:4:{s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"text\";s:1435:\"<p>Â </p><h1>Today I finished my<a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/freeprize/2012/05/the-shipit-journal-now-in-free-pdf-format.html\"> Ship It Journal</a>.Â </h1><h2>I am committed to putting on my live event, and I will stop at nothing to make it happen.

Looking forward to your honest thoughts.</p><p><b>Yolk 1-D Week 1 group members: (these link to each otherâs altmba)</b></p><ul><li>Seth Perler, Boulder, CO</li><li>Nic Bovee, Colorado Springs, CO</li><li>Yves Farges, Vancouver, BC Canada</li><li>Marcus Turner, Denver, CO</li></ul><h2><b>99 Micro Biz Plans</b></h2><ol><ol><li><b>âIndieEd Networkâ</b> - A new idea in education. A network connecting homeschoolers, unschoolers, people who are not enrolled in traditional schooling so they can help each other. There is a great need for these folks to get guidance to fill in the gaps with educating their kids. Many do not have education backgrounds and become overwhelmed.</li><li><b>Micro schooling</b> - An idea for a new type of school that is community run. A structure for how to implement it, completely nontraditional, creative, free, open. Let the design of these schools be driven by this question: What would be the coolest way in the world to create a school that best empowers learners to make their dent in the universe?</li><li><b>Strength school</b> - What if there was a school that was designed to build upon the strengths of the students? What if the teachers were skilled at helping students create and execute projects that were personally meaningful? What if students learned to execute projects, including all steps, from ideas to creation? This is not about perfection, it is about trying to build things that have purpose to the student. These things would require multiple disciplines and the teachers would serve as guides and mentors to walk students through the disciplines as well as managing the projects. There are no grades because it is not about compliance. There are self evaluations and evaluation meetings with mentors.</li><li><b>Teacher coworking</b>- Creating a coworking space for teachers who are NOT employed by schools but still want to teach, they teach homeschool classes, unschool, etc their way, for their pay. New paradigm based on the idea that teachers are artists and should be empowered to develop their craft rather than depend on following curriculum designed by big business. Teachers are seen and treated as professionals. What if there was a place where teachers could work together, inspire each other, support each other. What if teacher could develop their craft, set their own goals, build their own microbusinesses? What if there was a place where people could bring their kids, choose their classes, choose their teachers, do projects that are meaningful to the kids? What if teachers were trained to, rather than follow the curriculum prescription, they were trained to develop their strengths as teachers? What if teachers choose what classes to teach based on their passions and expertise? What if teachers made their own schedules? What if parents and teachers were empowered to collaborate in building the most engaging courses possible, as partners? What is these teachers were âfreelanceâ teachers? Itâs a new way to approach education. What if there were various classroom configurations and sizes that teachers could use to plan their expeditions with all materials you could possibly need?</li><li><b>Education coach training</b> - Teach people to become education coaches. Educational coaching is a <b>brand new field</b> that helps struggling students who donât fit into the proverbial box, navigate the outdated system effectively. It holistically helps with advocacy, executive function issues, social issues, emotional issues, academics, study skills, etc..</li><li><b>Gap life</b> - A business that guides kids through how to have life-changing gap years. Many kids are not ready for college but go straight after high school. An increasing number of kids are following Europeâs lead and taking gap years, years where they can have other experiences working, traveling, serving, etc.. This business would help families map out and execute safe and enriching experiences tailored to an individualâs strengths, interests, talents, values and passions.</li><li><b>Festival</b> - So many people want to reform education. Iâm not speaking about the corporate reformers! Noooooo, I mean other people who are itching to see change. What if there was an Educatio disrupt festival with bands, celebrities with learning disabilities, celebrating strengths, talents, and other things that aren\'t measured on tests??? What if it was constructed so that changemakers were speakers, if it was fun, if it empowered people to collaborate on small and large projects they could take back to their communities or on a bigger level? What if smaller changemakers came together to make NOISE so we can get education moving in a better direction much sooner!</li><li><b>Student advocacy business</b> - A problem I see all the time is that parents and their kids often do not have the tools or knowhow to advocate effectively. This business would consist of a few advocates who help families advocate in any and all ways necessary. They would help students learn to self-advocate. They would help parents know how to advocate by phone, email and in-person. They would advocate by supporting parents in the 4 main types of meetings; 504, IEP, RTI and conferences. They would help parents understand their rights and help them know when legal intervention is needed.</li><li><b>A different type of service project</b> - What if every school in developed countries had sibling schools or sibling projects.

To create a global cultural and historic context for these confessions, the interviews will be woven between some of the worldâs most poignant wisdom on the subject of the human condition and the purpose of a human life.

In a communal area that is adjoining a gallery, at home, . The work can be displayed for the public in the gallery... a local restaurant, anywhere art can be displayed and easily removed. Patronâs can pay a subscription costs of $25 per piece, per month, with a recurring monthly subscription. The gallery could also present an option for a year long contract commitment at a discounted price. Anytime a buyer wants to exchange his current piece for a new one, they simply visit the gallery and exchange it. If they keep it past a certain time, (based on appraised value) it then becomes their painting. Think Redbox.</li><li>The customer segments include local restaurants and businesses that need to decorate their businesses, real estate agents needing to stage a home, interior designers, Â individual collectors / buyers, and corporate donors. The pieces can also be purchased online through a website and mobile app. Patronâs can be encouraged to gift subscriptions and commission pieces.</li><li>What problem does this model solve ? Generally, everyone enjoys art. For the most part...everyone loves to have it around, they go to where it is being displayed, but they rarely , in a public setting, commit to the purchasing it. This model would help mitigate the perceived risks of the purchase, and it would keep artist in the area producing new work, and most importantly...sustaining their careers.</li><li>A portion of the space can be transformed into artists lofts, and then rented by by the artist for a very a small monthly or weekly fee. .A portion of the money collected can be allotted for the wholesale purchase of materials, and then re-sold to the artist in the gallery at just above costs. It shouldnât be any problem enticing 1000 people out of a city of 1,000,000, to subscribe to this cause. This would generate $25,000 in guaranteed revenue per month.

The funny thing is that when I drink more water, I don\'t feel terrible. Huh? Weird.</p><p>Having a water bottle around helps me consistently remember to stay hydrated. It has really helped with my efforts to stay active on a daily basis. Drinking water throughout the day just feels right, and I think that the cold water is really what draws me to it. I really like knowing how many ounces of fluids I\'m consuming every day.</p><h2>Thing #2</h2><hr /><p><strong>It\'s sexy.</strong></p><p>In a way the bottle is a fashion statement. I\'ve decked it out with stickers from places that I care about, and it\'s yet another way to express myself. The stainless steel, and powder coating make it an elegant addition to yourÂ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC\" target=\"_blank\">daily carry</a>Â gear. The metal is extremely shiny, which is awesome because I like shiny things. TheÂ rubberÂ seal fits on perfectly and lets out a reassuring \"Squeeeek\" to let me know that it is on tight enough. The plastic that makes up the lid and lid holder feel sturdy and are made from high-quality BPA-free plastic. It has a small rubber grip around the circumference of the lid which ensures I can open it even after the Incredible Hulk gets his hands on it.Â </p><h2>Thing #3</h2><div><hr /></div><p><strong>Do you want cold water? Because this is how you get cold water.</strong></p><p>I didn\'t always like cold water. In fact, there is a vast amount of research that suggests that human beings are better off drinking room temp or even warm water. Now I love cold water, and there isn\'t anything more satisfying in the summer heat, as taking a delicious swig from a nice cold water bottle. This bottle is insane. I\'ve left it in the car where it has gotten so hot I can hardly touch it, and the water inside is still cool. For hot drinks I kept tea in it, and was able to have hot tea throughout the day. I\'m also looking forward to snowboard season when I don\'t have to worry about my water bottle freezing like it has in the past.Â </p><p>Â </p><h2>1 month verdict: I love it</h2><p>So far so good. I have yet to find anything I don\'t like about it, and I should find something before too long. If you are someone who is in the market for a water bottle, this is for you. If you are someone who wishes their Nalgene kept things cool, shell out 34 bucks and give it a go.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can get them at your local <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/\">REI </a>store or head over to their <a href=\"https://www.hydroflask.com/\">site</a>, and see all of their swag.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:74:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6447-e1440560941334.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:10:\"slide-down\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:2;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:59:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6449.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:8:\"slide-up\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:3;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:74:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6479-e1441079580426.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:10:\"slide-left\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"3\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:2:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}}}'),(303,428,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(304,428,'_s2mail','yes'),(305,428,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','Hydro Flask'),(306,428,'_yoast_wpseo_linkdex','84'),(307,428,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Thinking about buying a Hydro Flask?

After clicking it and learning that it was their way of announcing a new logo, I thought: \"Hmm, I don\'t like it\". To me it just ruined the classic flair that Google. Their old logo was timeless, and even though it went through changes over the year, it was not nearly as grand as this one.

The dramatic change in the logo is a reminder of the dramatic changes they make in the world every day.</p><p>It also reminds me that like most species in the planet, I\'m averse to changes in my environment. The fact that my first response is to figure out what is wrong with it is an incredible reminder that change is happening around us all of the time. While it isn\'t helpful to jump on board with every change that\'s happening, I believe that it is important to spend time considering the possibility that the changes you\'ve been writing off are the same changes that could change your life.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:68:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/First-google-logo.gif\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:2;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:80:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/largeNewGoogleLogoFinalFlat-a.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:3;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:81:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Logo_Google_2013_Official.svg_.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"3\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:4;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:76:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"4\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:2:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}}}'),(312,443,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(313,443,'_s2mail','yes'),(314,443,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(315,682,'_edit_last','2'),(316,730,'_edit_last','2'),(317,730,'_s2mail','yes'),(318,454,'_edit_last','2'),(319,454,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(320,454,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(321,454,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(322,454,'_s2mail','yes'),(323,454,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','feedback'),(324,454,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Give people great feedback by challenging the tiny details that make up their idea.'),(325,454,'_yoast_wpseo_linkdex','85'),(326,454,'_thumbnail_id','455'),(327,454,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:29;}'),(328,464,'_edit_last','2'),(329,464,'_thumbnail_id','465'),(330,464,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(331,464,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(332,464,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(333,464,'_s2mail','yes'),(334,464,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','Early'),(335,464,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Waking up early isn\'t easy.

My poor parents had to stay focused on avoiding all of the insane cross-country drivers and traffic from most people\'s nightmares. Meanwhile my brother, sister and I entertained each otherÂ by converting the back seat of our green Plymouth Voyager into a UFC fighting ring. It was never easy for my parents on tripsÂ and it made me feel like there was no way of traveling without stress. This isn\'t a post about traveling anywhere you want in the world with young kids. Even though I\'m not a parent, I\'d imagine that there would be a challenge to that no matter what \"life hack\" you have working for you. This is post about getting over a few hurdles that are holding people back from doing, creating, and discovering new and incredible weekends, and adding 2,496 hours of vacation time to your year.</p><p>Â </p><p>\"I feel like going on a road trip but I don\'t know when we would go or where\" My friend Robby said over a basket of boneless garlic parmesan wings. \"What if we went to Mount Rushmore? It\'s only 6 hours away from Denver, and a friend of mine tells me it\'s a pretty cool road trip.\"Â </p><p>None of us had any vacation time, and since it was already October we were running out of opportunities for snow-free driving. If we wanted to do it that year we were going to need to get on it, and make it happen.Â </p><p>\"What if we went this weekend?\" I said half-jokingly.</p><p>That\'s all it took.</p><p>We left Saturday Morning and got back Sunday night. I got to see Mount Rushmore, and the (still uncompleted) Crazy Horse monument all over a short period of time that would have normallyÂ consisted of me binge watching Netflix in my underwear.</p><p>Since then I\'ve never been afraid to saying yes to the idea of a two-day adventure, and no to all of the things I would normally do over a weekend. This year we did a trip to the Grand Canyon from Colorado Springs Colorado.</p><p>2 day weekend + 24 hours of driving + awesome landmarks + friends + snacks = an experience I\'m glad I was willing to go after.</p><p>I emerged on the other side of this journey with some great pictures, a few stories, and a few little bits that I will chew on the next time I evaluate whether or not to do something like similarÂ in the future. Iâll throw these out to you to consider the next time you have a weekend, a few friends and a destination in mind. If youâre a parent Iâm sorry if this post doesnât help you make road tripping easier, but perhaps you will findÂ some other valueÂ in here that can add to your next road trip.</p><p>Here are a few stories people tell themselves:</p><ul><li>Planning a trip is difficult</li><li>Why would I go somewhere just to turn around and come back</li><li>It\'s going to feel like I didn\'t even get a weekend</li><li>I only have two days</li><li>I don\'t have the money for that</li></ul><p>Â </p><h3>When is the last time you had something other than \"good\" to say in response to the question \"how was your weekend?\" Â </h3><h3>It\'s time to go do that thing you\'ve always wanted to do but \"never had the time for.\"</h3><p>Agenda\'s for the most part are useless for this kind of experience. Part of unlocking these two days will require accepting the events as they come, and embracing them as part of the story.Â </p><div>We didnât have an agenda or a schedule setup to make this trip happen but if we did it would look something like this:</div><div>Â </div><ul><li>10:30pm Thursday Night - Meet roommate at Walmart to gather snacks</li><li>11:00pm Thursday Night - leave for AZ</li><li>2:00 am Friday Morning - Arrive in Gunnison Colorado to Pick up my girlfriend</li><li>11:00am Friday Morning - Arrive at Grand Canyon National Park</li><li>Friday during the day - Frolic around and enjoy the wonders of the Grand Canyon</li><li>Friday night - Stay at hotel in Flagstaff</li><li>8:00 am Saturday Morning - Head home</li><li>9:00pm Saturday Night - Arrive at home</li></ul><div>Â </div><div>Of course even though that was the idea, the actual trip ended up like this:</div><div>Â </div><ul><li>10:30pm Thursday Night - Meet roommate at Walmart to gather snacks</li><li>11:00pm Thursday Night- Roommate doesnât feel well and isnât sure he is going to be able to boot and rally</li><li>12:00amÂ Friday Morning - leave for AZ</li><li>12:15am Friday Morning - Stop at Taco Bueno for their awesome 60 Cent taco deal</li><li>1:00am Friday Morning - Finally on the road</li><li>4:00 am Friday Morning - Arrive in Gunnison Colorado to Pick up my girlfriend</li><li>6:30 am Friday Morning- Stop and get pictures of the sunrise over the beautiful colors of the aspens.</li><li>12:30pm Friday Afternoon- Stop at four corners (another monument Iâve wanted to visit.</li><li>3:00 pm Friday Afternoon - Arrive at Grand Canyon National Park</li><li>Friday for the remaining day- Enjoy the grand canyon, get pictures go to the gift shop and then head out for flagstaff.</li><li>Friday night - Go out on the town and stop at a dairy queen, then go to see the Martian, then stay at hotel in Flagstaff.</li><li>8:00 am - Grab coffee with a friend who attends college in Flagstaff</li><li>11:00 am Saturday Morning - Eat breakfast at an awesome diner</li><li>12:30pm Saturday afternoon- head home</li><li>2:00am Sunday morning - Arrive at home</li></ul><div>Â </div><div>Everybody knows that trips never go the way you think they are going to go, but thatâs not whatâs important. What is important is recognizing that no matter what happens during the journey itâs up to you to accept everything thatâs out of your control as the current reality, and focus your attention on all of the incredible upsides to the places you are experiencing and conversations you are having.</div><div>Â </div><div>In order to make this trip happen I needed to live withÂ two ideas:</div><div>Â </div><ol><li><h2><strong>I can live with less sleep for a few days</strong></h2></li><li><h2><strong>The joy from traveling has less to do with the destination and more to do with the journey to the destination</strong></h2></li></ol><div>Â </div><div>I recognize that lack of sleep and sitting in a car for 24 hours is tough, but sitting at the end of my life thinking about all of the things I wish I could do is a lot harder. The trip to the Grand Canyon was a lot of fun and offered some incredible scenery, conversations and experiences. I realize now that this trip opened my mind up to a new realm of possibility. For most people, itâs un-thinkable to donate the few days you have free from commitments to creating an experience that will last your lifetime. You may not be able to change the things you are committed to during your work week, but you do have the ability to change your thought process about what you can accomplish over a two day break. With this new level of thinking I look at my weekends in a whole new light. Instead of âchilling outâ watching Netflix, and dreading Monday morning, I see a chance to do something crazy. I can build something, go somewhere, learn, write, and explore.</div><div>Â </div><h2><strong>All of these things are available for you too.</strong></h2><div>Â </div><div>I offer a simple challenge: Take a look at what youâve done for the last 5 weekends. Now design a weekend that is completely different from the average of your 5 past weekends. In this way you can come away from the weekend with a new outlook on life, and greet your Monday morning with stories about a weekend you dared to create.</div><div>Â </div><h2><strong>Here are 5 simple rules to follow to createÂ memorable weekendÂ experiences:</strong></h2><div>Â </div><div><strong>Pick a destination -Â </strong>Choose a place that\'s outside of your comfort zone. a place that takes twice as long to get to as the usual place you might visit over a weekend.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Go with friends-Â </strong>Find a few people you love spending time with who will go with you on this incredible journey. Make sure that these are people you get along with well. If you get 4 people together and are willing to share, the cost of a hotel room becomes a whole lot less.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Don\'t plan too much-Â </strong>Stuff happens, and there isn\'t anything we can do about most of it. During a trip like this you must be willing to not take things to seriously and do your absolute best to focus your energy on only that which you can actually control.Â </div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Be prepared to not sleep-Â </strong>Sleep as much as you can leading up to the trip, but recognize that in order to add some hours to your life you have to be willing to trade some of your time. You may not need to do this for closer locations, but anything over 8 hours away starts to wear on you. ( Having friends with you also helps here because they can take on some of the driving.)</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Pretend like you are leaving the day before you actually are - </strong>This seems really obvious but it\'s amazing how much better my adventures go if I pretend like I\'m leaving the day before. Having a list helps with packing, but it\'s nice to not have the weight of hurrying to get ready to leave. No one wants to be the person that holds up the group.</div><div>Â </div><div><strong>Bonus! See the beauty in everything -</strong> Focus on the beauty all around you. You may not live where there are lots of pretty things to visit fairly close by, but I\'m sure there is somewhere that is different from what you are used to. Go find that place and look for the beauty that exists there. I know you can do it!</div><div>Â </div><div>Â </div>\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:11:\"panels_info\";a:5:{s:5:\"class\";s:31:\"SiteOrigin_Widget_Editor_Widget\";s:3:\"raw\";b:0;s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:4:\"cell\";i:0;s:2:\"id\";i:0;}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:0:\"\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:11:\"panels_info\";a:4:{s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:4:\"cell\";i:1;s:2:\"id\";i:1;}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:1;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}i:1;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:2;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}i:2;a:2:{s:5:\"cells\";i:2;s:5:\"style\";a:0:{}}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:5:{i:0;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:0;s:6:\"weight\";i:1;}i:1;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.6180339920920573;}i:2;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:1;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.3819660079079427;}i:3;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:2;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.3819660079079427;}i:4;a:2:{s:4:\"grid\";i:2;s:6:\"weight\";d:0.6180339920920573;}}}'),(619,597,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:1;}'),(620,597,'_edit_last','2'),(621,597,'_wp_page_template','default'),(622,597,'xyz_fbap','1'),(623,597,'_yoast_wpseo_content_score','30'),(624,97,'_edit_last','2'),(625,97,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(626,97,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(627,97,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(628,97,'wpb_post_views_count','0'),(629,97,'_s2mail','yes'),(630,97,'dsq_thread_id','3098402206'),(631,97,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(632,98,'_edit_last','2'),(633,98,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(634,98,'wpb_post_views_count','17'),(635,98,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(636,98,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(637,98,'dsq_thread_id','3137196040'),(638,98,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(639,320,'_edit_last','2'),(640,320,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(641,320,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(642,320,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(643,320,'_s2mail','yes'),(644,320,'_yoast_wpseo_opengraph-image','http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/book-decisive-265x440.png'),(645,320,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:31;}'),(646,329,'_edit_last','2'),(647,329,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(648,329,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(649,329,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(650,329,'_s2mail','yes'),(651,329,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:11;}'),(652,337,'_edit_last','2'),(653,337,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(654,337,'panels_data','a:3:{s:7:\"widgets\";a:2:{i:0;a:3:{s:3:\"src\";s:64:\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\";s:4:\"href\";s:64:\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:31:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widgets_Image\";}}i:1;a:4:{s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"text\";s:606:\"<h3>Goals.

If I didnât bring it up, you most likely wouldnât be considering the miracle that the electrical pulses in my head were converted into words, sent to my fingertips, converted into electrical signals sent to the computer through an infinitely complex set of protocols and mediums, then re-converted again to text and mapped out onto the millions of tiny lights on your monitor. You may also feel compelled to read this post for one reason or another, and right now Iâd like to ask you to consider moving on to the next post, or thing you have as an option in front of you. By choosing something other than what you see as your âcurrent activityâ, especially if it is something really ludicrous you have effectively <b>destroyed your frame</b>.</p><p>The frame is a helpful tool for recognizing the subconscious assumptions you make about every single aspect of your life. By recognizing the frame, you are shedding light on line that all opportunity stands behind, gazing longingly in at the fluff lucky enough to make it into the limelight. That fluff is inside of your frame for one simple reason. You want it there. It is the thing or things that resonated with your emotions causing you to quickly form the assumption that it deserves your attention. It is the fluff that makes a decision difficult. It is time to wake up to the reality. Outside of the small canvas of options you have painted within the frame of your decision, lies a gallery rife with even better options that werenât even allowed onto your paint brush. Destroy your frame. Tear it off of the wall and embrace the world of possibilities that lie in front of you. Unplug from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwq7b2i-vc\">the Matrix</a> youâve created for yourself and see whatâs really available for you. Time is of the essence, so now that youâve emerged on the other side, take a deep breath. Letâs make a decision.</p><h5>It starts with the change agent. A problem that needs solving.</h5><p>A person came into a computer shop I worked at and asked the question: âShould I buy a Mac? I hear they are a lot easier to use and my PC has been running so slow.â What is this personâs problem? What change agent caused them to start a decision process in the first place?</p><p>That is when the Apple elitist in me screams: âDuh, theyâre on a freaking PC, of course itâs slow and frustrating!â. Ladies and Gentleman I present in all of its narrow minded glory, a frame. You may not see the danger, but imagine me giving that person information based on what my frame of their problem says the obvious choice is. Itâs just plain foolish to set one option on a scale without a counter option to balance it out and come to a reasonable, educated decision. Itâs time to destroy the frame and rebuild it around options that matter. Here is how we do it:</p><h3><strong>Ask off the wall questions-</strong></h3><p>How educated is she when it comes to PC? How long has she had her PC? Could she do more of the things that she finds frustrating on the PC in a more familiar environment? Does she have any friends that she can borrow a Mac from to ensure that she isnât switching to something that will have a learning curve? How do they like living in Colorado? What is their favorite television show?What is the price difference between a low end Mac and a high end PC? You get the picture. Make cases for both sides of the argument. Pose as many questions as possible and donât be afraid of the questions that donât seem to have any relation to the problem.</p><h3><strong>Trash the options your frame dealt you-</strong></h3><p>In most cases while confronting a decision, our frame usually submits a few ideas for consideration. Throw them out of the equation all together. This leaves you with one problem and zero solutions. Innovate. If that option wasnât available how then could we solve the problem. Switching to Mac isnât an option, and this person desperately needs to feel less frustrated when using a PC. What about switching to Linux? Or not using a computer at all? It seems that innovation is usually brought into existence because it is demanded. Demand innovation. Paint the frame, then the gallery, then demolish the gallery, and force yourself to migrate your art onto the hull of a spaceship.</p><h3><strong>Consider the opportunity cost-</strong></h3><p>If one of their options is to spend a minimum of $700 on a Mac, could that money be used to solve the problem using a different option? Â What is the opportunity cost of all of your options. What opportunity are you giving up to make the current option you are considering?</p><p>Now assess the options. Borrow Mac from a friend and evaluate it for 10 dayâs. Become more familiar with working in a PC environment(unfortunately this does mean learning a thing or two about basic maintenance). Start working through options to ease into the decision. Try the cheapest options first and consider setting a timeline that tells you when you will take the plunge.</p><p>Now build a new frame, the proper frame your new set of options deserve.Start to strategically migrate the options that seem least likely to solve the original problem to the outside, and sit back and appreciate the different features of each option you now have in front of you.</p><p>Left with a handful of reasonable options, including ones that you may have never considered, it is time to decide.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p><strong>Framing is usually done without unconsciously, which means it relies on our deeper self, and does not provide a platform for our better options to breathe. We must destroy that frame and rebuild it around a set of options that includes the options that fell into the crowd of ideas that got instantly shoved aside when the problem presented itself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ask any question that pops into your head to try and get some off the wall ideas and solutions for handling the problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Take the obvious solution out of the picture all together and ask a new question such as: â If solution x canât happen, what can I do instead to solve problem y?â</strong></p><p><strong>Consider the opportunity cost: âWhat value would one decision give that another one wouldnât?â</strong></p><h4>BONUS: How does this apply to the educational system?</h4><p>Frame: Students must be tested and graded in order to ensure that they are learning, and that our teachers are doing their jobs.</p><p>What problem is this solving? We donât know if kids are learning, and if the teacher is doing their job.</p><h4>Off the wall questions-</h4><p>Who is the educational system for, the kids or the administrative board?</p><p>Why are schools all inside?</p><p>Why does every kid need to go to school?</p><p>What are they really getting from it?</p><p>What does the grading system measure?</p><p>Who benefits most from the grading system?</p><h4>Remove the current solution all together-</h4><p>In a school with no grading system how would teachers know that their students understand the material?</p><p>Give smaller tests on each subject and find out where kids are struggling and frame their concepts differently so they might have a better chance to understand the material.</p><p>Allow kids to work at their own pace and put more emphasis on challenging them to try new things.</p><h4>Opportunity Cost-</h4><p>What could the money that goes into testing and grading be used for?</p><p>It is estimated that 1.7 billion dollars is spent on testing every year which could easily be used to implement better programs that support learning.</p><p>By not grading, the teachers have more time to spend working with kids ensuring that they donât need help understanding the various concepts.</p><p>To read more about this issue be sure to check out my friend <a href=\"https://altmba.com/sethperler/how-to-make-good-decisions-about-standardized-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sethâs post</a>.</p><hr /><p><i>About this project: This is post 2/5 on Project 1 of altMBA.

It\'s been awesome to hear all of the great feedback! I think that one of the most common critiques was on the weakness of the article towards the end. I think that there are three ways to approach an issue of lack luster content.</p><p>1. When you start to feel like the content you are producing is weak and not enjoyable to write, scrap it and move on to something that is.</p><p>2.Read each sentence carefully to find out which sentence is the most boring, then ditch those select sentences.</p><p>3.Re-read the paper as Ryon mentioned and come up with an idea of how it sounds.</p><p>I\'ve also concluded that the bonus section couldÂ either be done away with, setup as an additional example, or moved into a separate post.</p><p>If I were to re-write this post, I would condense it by chopping out my own fluff that I felt like I needed to satisfy the project. What I have to say is only important if people are awake long enough to read it.</p><p>In order to practice what I preach starting now:</p><p>That\'s it.

You donât seem to really like it at all. Your friends see it. People you work with see it. The people you save when you are living in your callingÂ see it too. Why canât you embrace it? What worldly threat is holding you back from living as superman all of the time?</p><h6>To be Clark Kent and brush your calling to the side, is to deny yourself time spent operating as the creature you were intended to be.</h6><p>It is time to sell the bullshit you bought, and start to work with what you were given. Youâve got no time to lose! Imagine a life where you wake up excited for the day and you have trouble going to sleep because your day was filled to the brim with people and experiences worth having again, and again. What does your day look like?</p><p>Hurrah! If you can search inside yourself and identify the answer, congratulations! Youâve now fertilized the catalyst of a very long journey ahead. It is going to be a very challenging several months, and there will be plenty of complications. However, it will pay off. Your body now roams the planet conscious of its one purpose: Deliver this beautiful, previously unknown part of myself into the world, and walk with it through its incredible life ahead.</p><h4><strong>Set your goals.</strong></h4><p><strong>Conceive the dream.</strong> Carry it through its development. Release it into the world kicking, screaming, and smashing through the barriers that were put in place before its conception.</p><p><strong>What do those barriers look like?</strong></p><p><strong>What must you learn along the way?</strong></p><p><strong>Who needs to be apart of your support circle?</strong></p><p>Finally, <strong>set its due date!</strong> You are an excited new parent and canât wait to meet your child.</p><p>Rejoice when it comes to fruition, breathes the air of the earth and can be remarked on by others fortunate enough to meet it.</p><p>My name is Nic Bovee. I dream of a life spent helping entities bigger than myself with a team of people who always challenge the status quo. My goal is to rely less on my position as Clark Kent, and dare to fly into the unknown as the super hero I was placed on earth to be. I love being asked questions I donât know the answer to. I love to collaborate with a team of people who enjoy the same. It would be so refreshing to operate with a team of âA+â players who donât allow me to stay tucked away in the safe bowels of my comfort zone. The path to living my dream comes with many adversaries. The biggest challenge being the mentality I have created for myself.</p><p>â You cannot survive on your own!â</p><p>âYouâre not smart enough! â</p><p>âYou depend on other people to live! â</p><p>Pushing against those barriers until my newly achieved goal can break through them is going to be almost impossible. Itâs going to take a lifestyle that permits learning, and developing new things while still functioning safely in the company. It will take me stepping out and assembling a team of people who are the best in the world at what they do. It will take my vulnerability to step out and actively look for the bigger entities that have problems that our elite team can solve for them.</p><p>My plan of action is this.</p><p>Start now. Reach out to the people in my existing circle and find out if they want to be apart of something like this. Start acting like a company, and set deadlines for the projects Iâm already involved in. Learn how to pay taxes like a company. Tune in to what it is I actually do on the team, and pitch it to the people who I want to work with.</p><p><strong>My Deadline</strong></p><p>June 15<sup>th</sup> 2016-It is the one-year anniversary of the day I started the most important transformation of my life. I will be spending an equal portion of my time during the week meeting with my team and talking through the current challenges our firm faces. My price structure will be fully developed as a piece of art. I will have at minimum 5 projects at a time, and will be actively networking to gain at least 5 more for the next month. We will ship on time. We will ship great work. I will have learned new things from the 50+ books I add to my library. Most importantly, I will be shedding new light on my current job and hopefully applying some of the concepts from my company into the weaknesses of the one I work for. Itâs not going to be easy, and Iâll need to constantly monitor the course and change as need be.</p><p>Creating all of this will be worth it. When I reach the top I will have brought along stories that either tell of the bounty of success or the lessons from a successful failure.</p><h3><strong>P.S.</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of my article, I was really leaving an opening or invitation for readers to join in and set some goals of their own. I left the door open, but never told anyone to go in. As <strong><a href=\"https://altmba.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=post&amp;author=133\">Seth Perler</a></strong> pointed out, I should make a point of letting the reader know that there is an opportunity and to get the most out of my article they should take it.</p><h4><strong>Updated Plan of action- Upon Michelleâs request</strong></h4><p><strong>Restate my goal (With meat):</strong></p><p>I want to live a life where I work with companies that want to push themselves to a new level of greatness by helping them make decisions on the creative front. This includes:</p><p><strong>Branding</strong>- Designing the story behind the image, then updating the image to reflect the story. I want to design a workflow that will ask the questions that need to be asked in order to discover what the companyâs story is.</p><p><strong>Logo Design</strong>- Whether itâs a redesign for branding or a start to finish creation, my goal is to be a company that takes the culture of a company, and creates a logo for them. Iâve done this for a few different people, and Iâve really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Web Site Design</strong>- This is definitely an element of my structure that will require looking for a great developer who can work with me on developing a strategic method of laying out a site in order to provide an easy experience that doesnât feel âbrokenâ.</p><p><strong>Customer Relationship Design</strong>- Most small companies I talk to donât care about the actual relationship that they have with their customers. It sucks because they miss out on such an awesome opportunity to make the customer want to keep coming back for more than just the product that they sell.</p><p><strong>Customer Experience Design</strong>- From start to finish, I want to build the street that a customer walks down when they use that company. This has a lot to do with Sethâs Purple Cow concept, as well as tribes. It think that most companies leave the community out of it. What needs to happen is a new focus on doing things that wow the customer. Zappos had free 2 day shipping as something they did to upgrade the customerâs order from free standard shipping. Sweetwater sends smarties with musical widget they send. I want to evaluate the customer experience by having people go through the entire interaction with the company, and come up with a list of things the loved and things they disliked.</p><p><strong>Value Development</strong>- Work on actual projects the customer is working on to offer insight on how they can add even more value to what they are offering by means of adding a few features, or simply revising the way they pitch the product. This process will rely heavily on the information we have from the strong customer relationships and using it to offer something that speaks to them.</p><p><strong>Company Structure Design</strong>- This first came from an experience I had as general manager of a computer shop. This involves looking at the internal workflow. I want to look at what the business does internally and help them find a better way to accomplish more things, faster! I think that itâs difficult to see the inefficiency if you are used to looking at it every day. We come in and identify the top things that could change in one week that would help a company be more efficient in the way that it runs and handles itself.</p><h4><strong>Pushing against the obstacles</strong></h4><p><strong>Who will I reach out to?</strong></p><p>Two groups of people</p><p><strong>Internal</strong>- People I know personally who would be a lot of help and want to be a part of this company or know people who might. The smaller goal here is to build a team of people that expand the diversity of the promises we can make to our customers. By knowing the people apart of this, we can make promises and exceed them to provide our customers with an exceptional experience</p><p>People from internal are filling certain roles of the kind of experience our group wants to create:</p><p>WebÂ Â Â Â Â  MarketingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Internal StructureÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  EducationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DevelopersÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Graphics Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â BrandingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Value Development</p><p>Jon Dale- Close personal friend and the reason Iâm aware of Seth Godin and in the altMBA</p><p>Todd A. - Web</p><p>Justin L. - Social Marketing</p><p>Andy T. â Develop the network</p><p>Josh K. â Learning materials</p><p>Kevin M. â Becoming an entrepreneur vs. a free lancer</p><p>Stephen D. â Developer connections</p><p>Jason R. â Developer connections</p><p>Brooke B. â Marketing</p><p><strong>External</strong>- Companies that have people in them who want to make the company more than just a Car dealership. More than just a coffee shop. More than an okay place to go buy jewelry. Places that are used to dealing with pricy corporate establishments that use the same methods they have used for the last 20 years to offer a solution of one facet of the customers problem. I want to start small with people I have already worked with and know, offering new value that their company can begin to implement, until I have a method I can start to practice on a bigger company.</p><p>The PC Shop</p><p>G1 Equip</p><p>MakeExerciseEasy</p><p>Recycles</p><p>DTG</p><p>CreativeIvoryMusic</p><p>Moutain Scoops</p><p>Team TeleCycle</p><p>Jives</p><h4>Why will they want to be a part of what Iâm doing?</h4><p><strong>Internal</strong>- Not all of them will be a part of it directly, but they may point me in the direction of people who will want to be part of it directly. I think that if I am connected with the right people, the idea of scheduling time to collaborate and sharing contracts with people who are the best at what they do will be an attractive offer for people who may be wasting their time at a job they get nothing from.</p><p><strong>External-</strong>I believe that when presented with an opportunity to invigorate the working environment and increase their exposure to people who care, as well as overall productivity and financial performance. I see it as them making the decision to hire a life coach that helps the company find what it wants just as much as it helps the employees.</p><h4><strong>What will I ask specifically?</strong></h4><p>Internal- Why do you do what you do? If their passionate I want to connect them with the companies that are passionate.</p><h4><strong>What is the project they are actually joining?</strong></h4><p>That varies based on the client. Some of my clients have wanted minimal changes to be made on one page of their site. Others have had me re design their logo and analyze their business structure.</p><h4>How will I specifically act like a company?</h4><p>Stephen Pressfield brought up the idea of meeting with yourself weekly. Thanks Stephen! I want to meet on a week by week basis and set goals for my âCompanyâ as if I already had the accountability of people who were waiting for me to give them a project to do.Â  I also want to spend time developing my whole business model, to understand what kind of company it is that Iâm really describing.</p><h4><strong>List the projects that need deadlines.</strong></h4><p>Current projects that need deadlines are all web based projects. I am rotten liar to myself. I tell myself that I donât have time to spend on the project. Wrong. I will start by setting a dead line to have a fully written Web Design questionnaire by next Wednesday.</p><h4><strong>How will I learn to pay taxes like a company?</strong></h4><p>This is one that Iâm hoping I can find info on from my cohort or the altMBA family. I think it will be quite a while before I can hire a book keeper or CPA. What book can I read that will teach me how to manage an LLC in terms of taxes, and not get screwed over.</p><h4><strong>What is that you want to do? How will you pitch it?</strong></h4><p>Iâm passionate about many things, but there are two things that out-weigh the rest. Design, and people.</p><p>I love to see and understand why things were created the way they were. When I can afford to do it without debt, I will go to college for design both industrial, and graphic. The thing that I really love looking at is details, and in this job I get to explore details in almost every aspect of my favorite hobby: business. I also love people. I want to create something that is as much a community as it is a company. A place for creatives. These creatives might be paying the community, or they might be getting paid. We all are passionate about building plan Z first and shipping a day early than we were expected.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"3\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:4:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}i:2;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:3;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:5:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:18:\"0.4996331621423331\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:18:\"0.5003668378576669\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:3;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"2\";}i:4;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"3\";}}}'),(710,395,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(711,395,'_s2mail','yes'),(712,395,'_yoast_wpseo_title','Superman-Nic Bovee'),(713,395,'_oembed_67632d3d1981e5b31d3792bb5ac27005','<iframe width=\"654\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3SVDJRBSyM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>'),(714,395,'_oembed_time_67632d3d1981e5b31d3792bb5ac27005','1437350665'),(715,395,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(716,395,'_oembed_e188de234fc87251053f9de452828296','{{unknown}}'),(717,399,'_edit_last','2'),(718,399,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(719,399,'panels_data','a:3:{s:7:\"widgets\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:\"video\";s:27:\"http://youtu.be/0bZCjIVlx4g\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widgets_EmbeddedVideo\";}}i:1;a:4:{s:4:\"type\";s:6:\"visual\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";s:4:\"text\";s:1435:\"<p>Â </p><h1>Today I finished my<a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/freeprize/2012/05/the-shipit-journal-now-in-free-pdf-format.html\"> Ship It Journal</a>.Â </h1><h2>I am committed to putting on my live event, and I will stop at nothing to make it happen.

We probably came up with a few hundred at least and whittled it down to these. Looking forward to your honest thoughts.</p><p><b>Yolk 1-D Week 1 group members: (these link to each otherâs altmba)</b></p><ul><li>Seth Perler, Boulder, CO</li><li>Nic Bovee, Colorado Springs, CO</li><li>Yves Farges, Vancouver, BC Canada</li><li>Marcus Turner, Denver, CO</li></ul><h2><b>99 Micro Biz Plans</b></h2><ol><ol><li><b>âIndieEd Networkâ</b> - A new idea in education. A network connecting homeschoolers, unschoolers, people who are not enrolled in traditional schooling so they can help each other. There is a great need for these folks to get guidance to fill in the gaps with educating their kids. Many do not have education backgrounds and become overwhelmed.</li><li><b>Micro schooling</b> - An idea for a new type of school that is community run. A structure for how to implement it, completely nontraditional, creative, free, open. Let the design of these schools be driven by this question: What would be the coolest way in the world to create a school that best empowers learners to make their dent in the universe?</li><li><b>Strength school</b> - What if there was a school that was designed to build upon the strengths of the students? What if the teachers were skilled at helping students create and execute projects that were personally meaningful? What if students learned to execute projects, including all steps, from ideas to creation? This is not about perfection, it is about trying to build things that have purpose to the student. These things would require multiple disciplines and the teachers would serve as guides and mentors to walk students through the disciplines as well as managing the projects. There are no grades because it is not about compliance. There are self evaluations and evaluation meetings with mentors.</li><li><b>Teacher coworking</b>- Creating a coworking space for teachers who are NOT employed by schools but still want to teach, they teach homeschool classes, unschool, etc their way, for their pay. New paradigm based on the idea that teachers are artists and should be empowered to develop their craft rather than depend on following curriculum designed by big business. Teachers are seen and treated as professionals. What if there was a place where teachers could work together, inspire each other, support each other. What if teacher could develop their craft, set their own goals, build their own microbusinesses? What if there was a place where people could bring their kids, choose their classes, choose their teachers, do projects that are meaningful to the kids? What if teachers were trained to, rather than follow the curriculum prescription, they were trained to develop their strengths as teachers? What if teachers choose what classes to teach based on their passions and expertise? What if teachers made their own schedules? What if parents and teachers were empowered to collaborate in building the most engaging courses possible, as partners? What is these teachers were âfreelanceâ teachers? Itâs a new way to approach education. What if there were various classroom configurations and sizes that teachers could use to plan their expeditions with all materials you could possibly need?</li><li><b>Education coach training</b> - Teach people to become education coaches. Educational coaching is a <b>brand new field</b> that helps struggling students who donât fit into the proverbial box, navigate the outdated system effectively. It holistically helps with advocacy, executive function issues, social issues, emotional issues, academics, study skills, etc..</li><li><b>Gap life</b> - A business that guides kids through how to have life-changing gap years. Many kids are not ready for college but go straight after high school. An increasing number of kids are following Europeâs lead and taking gap years, years where they can have other experiences working, traveling, serving, etc.. This business would help families map out and execute safe and enriching experiences tailored to an individualâs strengths, interests, talents, values and passions.</li><li><b>Festival</b> - So many people want to reform education. Iâm not speaking about the corporate reformers! Noooooo, I mean other people who are itching to see change. What if there was an Educatio disrupt festival with bands, celebrities with learning disabilities, celebrating strengths, talents, and other things that aren\'t measured on tests??? What if it was constructed so that changemakers were speakers, if it was fun, if it empowered people to collaborate on small and large projects they could take back to their communities or on a bigger level? What if smaller changemakers came together to make NOISE so we can get education moving in a better direction much sooner!</li><li><b>Student advocacy business</b> - A problem I see all the time is that parents and their kids often do not have the tools or knowhow to advocate effectively. This business would consist of a few advocates who help families advocate in any and all ways necessary. They would help students learn to self-advocate. They would help parents know how to advocate by phone, email and in-person. They would advocate by supporting parents in the 4 main types of meetings; 504, IEP, RTI and conferences. They would help parents understand their rights and help them know when legal intervention is needed.</li><li><b>A different type of service project</b> - What if every school in developed countries had sibling schools or sibling projects. WHat if these were service based relationships? WHat if both sibling schools asked the other what they need and each year these communities tried to create something the other needed? What would these experiences do to help kids feel a part of a global community? How would these experiences of service influence how students think about the world? Itâs not about the project, itâs about the process.</li><li><b>Build your own curriculum app for homeschoolers</b>- that starts with what you want to learn and helps you implement it. Many homeschoolers donât have the experience to develop curriculum creatively or to know if they are covering all the bases. This would have questions the user would answer in relation to topics of study and it would build for them a framework they can adapt to their situation with suggestions.</li><li><b>kid.safe.social.com</b> - A premium, highly regulated social networking site that is 100% safe for kids. Extensive application process, fee based, geared towards dif ages, etc.. So parents KNOW their kids are safe online. This idea can be applied to a Kidsafe browser - premium browser managed by the company to guarantee kidsafe browsing. Eliminates the need for blockers and such. Could also be a Kidsafe laptop or phone.</li><li><b>Executive function app</b>: Executive function is the single most important concept for parents and teachers to understand if they are to help outside-the-box learners who are not meeting âpotentialâ. Unfortunately, the literature on EF is not in layman\'s terms and people who think they understand it do not. What if there was an app with an assessment that then explained your EF style and things you could do to develop it? Game changer.</li><li><b>Yoga coworking</b> - A coworking space for yoga teachers (and the like) to mastermind, help each other grow as entrepreneurs, etc.. They could rent various sizes of spaces so they can create programming that <b>they</b> profit from. This empowers the little guy. It helps them learn the biz of yoga - Teaching yoga teachers how to be entrepreneurs so they arenât slaves to the imbalanced system that keeps them poor.</li><li><b>Build a guitar kit</b> - Many guitarists come to a point where they want to take a stab at building a guitar. There are many ways to do this, there are companies that sell the individual parts, there are luthiers you can learn from, but after 25 years of playing, I have never seen a <b>kit</b> that walks a person through the entire process of building their own guitars.</li></ol></ol><ul><li><b><b>Flat rate airline </b>- What if there was an airline that had flat rates? What if you went to their website and knew exactly how much it costs for various aspects of the service? No manipulating prices, no games, just honest and clarity regarding pricing.</b></li></ul><ol><li><b>Bike microchip</b> - Bike theft is a huge issue in many areas. A bike microchip could help locate stolen or lost bikes. The microchip could go down the frame and could be adhered perm</li><li><b>Smart camera</b> - Many people want to become ârealâ photographers. In other words, they want to learn to use the <b>manual</b> settings on a camera. You can take classes and such, but what if there was a real dslr camera that taught you how to use the manual settings, that walked you through it step by step, shot by shot. You could use the guidance or just shoot, but the camera is designed to give you the knowledge necessary to master these powerful tools.</li><li><b>A new take on healthcare</b> - Huge problems with the healthcare system, whatâs the solution? Perhaps a biz that vets indie health and wellness providers to insurance companies.</li><li><b>Cancer advocates</b> - A small company who seeks to to deal with the red tape that cancer patients deal with. They would do the research on the difficult questions, talk to the doctors, provide the client with an UNBIASED person on the side of the patient to help navigate a scary and confusing medical and insurance world.</li><li><b>Homeless camp</b> - Many of the homeless choose the lifestyle. The police are constantly looking for their âcampsâ and forcing them to âmove on.â They donât have anywhere to move on to. What if there was a âcampâ that was designated as a safe place, a community area that supported the homeless?</li><li><b>Fun.eral.com</b> - We put the FUN in Funeral. For people who want to design their own funeral, particularly as a celebration of their lives. This would be a company who empowers the dying to design their ideal funeral in a celebratory manner, based on their wishes and values. Of course there would be support for people to go through their own grief process in a healthy manner. This does not in any way seek to make fun of or make light of the real need for healthy processing of grief. Â But the point is that it breaks the status quo and allows people to choose a ceremony that is personally meaningful.</li><li><b>Marijuana dependency help</b> - I live in Colorado, and as the marijuana legalization is changing the business landscape, more and more people are experiencing difficulties with Marijuana dependency. More people are wanting help with these issues, and as the marijuana industry grows, itâs likely that the need for help with these issues will grow as well.</li><li><b>Prison inmate support</b> - What if there was a company who empowered inmates to contribute to a book that goes to prisons and gives inmates an option to send their thoughts to other parts in the world. What if Ex-cons who turned it around were paid to go back into the prisons and teach inmates how to make it back in the world?</li><li><b>Custom in-ear headphones</b> - Headphones often come with a few sizes of the rubber pieces that are inserted in the ear, and none of them ever seem to fit right. What if you could take a cast of your ear safely, ship it to the company and they made custom noise cancelling headphones for your ear!</li><li><b>Lyme Disease Network</b> - Lyme disease is a quickly growing problem, particularly in the Northeast. No longer can you get a tick without worrying if it carried Lyme. This disease has profound effects on the people who have it, from aches and pains to a debilitating lack of energy. Unfortunately, the word is spreading slowly for various reasons. This business would be a social networking site that educated and connected. THere would be a section with major articles, links to specialists, and other needed resources in one place.</li><li><b>Sober nightclub</b> - What if there was a clean and sober nightclub with music, comedy, entertainment for people who do not want to be around all the alcohol and drugs?</li><li>Rugged Camp- A choose your own adventure experience<p>Resources-Big Company Resources.</p><p>This is a camp for doing burly, rugged things. Youâll need to grab an ax and run out to the forest and chop down a tree that you haul back to the cabin. Youâll learn how to hunt, and shoot better than ever with our professional training program. Youâll also get to be apart of several high adrenaline gravity sports such as; Rock climbing, mountain climbing, ropes courses, and cliff jumps. This is a company that provides a unique custom tailored value that caters to only the bravest, and adventurous customer segments. It will involve partnerships with companies that have access to this land as well as partnerships with outdoor gear and training companies. Unlike most babyâs first adult âAdventureâ camps, this camp is only for people who take calculated risks and arenât afraid of working hard for a thrill.

This product is a small box of cards that you would present during a dinner party among friends that present valuable philosophical ice breakers that delve into the hearts of the people around the table. People could answer the questions, then get involved in the online community who are also asking the questions. We would build the questions by presenting some of todayâs philosophers with a list of items the question must satisfy. Ex- âWhat is it forâ - Seth Godin.

Patronâs can pay a subscription costs of $25 per piece, per month, with a recurring monthly subscription. The gallery could also present an option for a year long contract commitment at a discounted price. Anytime a buyer wants to exchange his current piece for a new one, they simply visit the gallery and exchange it. If they keep it past a certain time, (based on appraised value) it then becomes their painting.

It shouldnât be any problem enticing 1000 people out of a city of 1,000,000, to subscribe to this cause. This would generate $25,000 in guaranteed revenue per month.

The funny thing is that when I drink more water, I don\'t feel terrible. Huh? Weird.</p><p>Having a water bottle around helps me consistently remember to stay hydrated. It has really helped with my efforts to stay active on a daily basis. Drinking water throughout the day just feels right, and I think that the cold water is really what draws me to it. I really like knowing how many ounces of fluids I\'m consuming every day.</p><h2>Thing #2</h2><hr /><p><strong>It\'s sexy.</strong></p><p>In a way the bottle is a fashion statement. I\'ve decked it out with stickers from places that I care about, and it\'s yet another way to express myself. The stainless steel, and powder coating make it an elegant addition to yourÂ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC\" target=\"_blank\">daily carry</a>Â gear. The metal is extremely shiny, which is awesome because I like shiny things. TheÂ rubberÂ seal fits on perfectly and lets out a reassuring \"Squeeeek\" to let me know that it is on tight enough. The plastic that makes up the lid and lid holder feel sturdy and are made from high-quality BPA-free plastic. It has a small rubber grip around the circumference of the lid which ensures I can open it even after the Incredible Hulk gets his hands on it.Â </p><h2>Thing #3</h2><div><hr /></div><p><strong>Do you want cold water? Because this is how you get cold water.</strong></p><p>I didn\'t always like cold water. In fact, there is a vast amount of research that suggests that human beings are better off drinking room temp or even warm water. Now I love cold water, and there isn\'t anything more satisfying in the summer heat, as taking a delicious swig from a nice cold water bottle. This bottle is insane. I\'ve left it in the car where it has gotten so hot I can hardly touch it, and the water inside is still cool. For hot drinks I kept tea in it, and was able to have hot tea throughout the day. I\'m also looking forward to snowboard season when I don\'t have to worry about my water bottle freezing like it has in the past.Â </p><p>Â </p><h2>1 month verdict: I love it</h2><p>So far so good. I have yet to find anything I don\'t like about it, and I should find something before too long. If you are someone who is in the market for a water bottle, this is for you. If you are someone who wishes their Nalgene kept things cool, shell out 34 bucks and give it a go.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can get them at your local <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/\">REI </a>store or head over to their <a href=\"https://www.hydroflask.com/\">site</a>, and see all of their swag.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:74:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6447-e1440560941334.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:10:\"slide-down\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:2;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:59:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6449.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:8:\"slide-up\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:3;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:74:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6479-e1441079580426.jpg\";s:9:\"animation\";s:10:\"slide-left\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"3\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:2:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}}}'),(770,428,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(771,428,'_s2mail','yes'),(772,428,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','Hydro Flask'),(773,428,'_yoast_wpseo_linkdex','84'),(774,428,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Thinking about buying a Hydro Flask?

Do you hate it?</strong></h1><p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8juvvEzwdo\">Tuesday morning</a> of this week everyone in the world had a funny looking play button on the google icon when they used it.Â </p><p>I myself was one of these people. Even though I only click on about 5% of all of the doodles that Google has to offer, I was intrigued by the big blue Play button and had to find out what it all meant. After clicking it and learning that it was their way of announcing a new logo, I thought: \"Hmm, I don\'t like it\". To me it just ruined the classic flair that Google. Their old logo was timeless, and even though it went through changes over the year, it was not nearly as grand as this one. Switching to a completely different style of font just seemed wrong and I didn\'t think it looked like Google.Â </p><p>As I was thinking about it, it dawned on me.Â </p><h2><strong>Google is a change company.</strong></h2><p>Sure they are a search engine company too, but the reason people work at Google has way more to do with the idea that a person can be \"Googly\". The dramatic change in the logo is a reminder of the dramatic changes they make in the world every day.</p><p>It also reminds me that like most species in the planet, I\'m averse to changes in my environment. The fact that my first response is to figure out what is wrong with it is an incredible reminder that change is happening around us all of the time. While it isn\'t helpful to jump on board with every change that\'s happening, I believe that it is important to spend time considering the possibility that the changes you\'ve been writing off are the same changes that could change your life.</p>\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"0\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"class\";s:30:\"WP_Widget_Black_Studio_TinyMCE\";}}i:1;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:68:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/First-google-logo.gif\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:2;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:80:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/largeNewGoogleLogoFinalFlat-a.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"2\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:3;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:81:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Logo_Google_2013_Official.svg_.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"3\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}i:4;a:3:{s:5:\"image\";s:76:\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\";s:9:\"animation\";s:4:\"fade\";s:4:\"info\";a:4:{s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"cell\";s:1:\"1\";s:2:\"id\";s:1:\"4\";s:5:\"class\";s:39:\"SiteOrigin_Panels_Widget_Animated_Image\";}}}s:5:\"grids\";a:2:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"1\";}i:1;a:1:{s:5:\"cells\";s:1:\"2\";}}s:10:\"grid_cells\";a:3:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"0\";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}i:2;a:2:{s:6:\"weight\";s:3:\"0.5\";s:4:\"grid\";s:1:\"1\";}}}'),(779,443,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(780,443,'_s2mail','yes'),(781,443,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:0:{}'),(782,682,'_edit_last','2'),(783,730,'_edit_last','2'),(784,730,'_s2mail','yes'),(785,454,'_edit_last','2'),(786,454,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(787,454,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(788,454,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(789,454,'_s2mail','yes'),(790,454,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','feedback'),(791,454,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Give people great feedback by challenging the tiny details that make up their idea.'),(792,454,'_yoast_wpseo_linkdex','85'),(793,454,'_thumbnail_id','455'),(794,454,'dpsp_networks_shares','a:1:{s:8:\"facebook\";i:29;}'),(795,464,'_edit_last','2'),(796,464,'_thumbnail_id','465'),(797,464,'ninja_forms_form','0'),(798,464,'panels_data','a:0:{}'),(799,464,'masonry_settings','a:1:{s:4:\"size\";s:2:\"11\";}'),(800,464,'_s2mail','yes'),(801,464,'_yoast_wpseo_focuskw','Early'),(802,464,'_yoast_wpseo_metadesc','Waking up early isn\'t easy.

Even though we aim to consistently design ahead of the curve with the latest media strategy, we still operate with old fashion core values. That\'s why we start every relationship like most people do,Â with a handshake. We don\'t want a relationship that isn\'t authentic. If it seems like yourÂ needs areÂ better met by another agency, we want to find an agency with a better solution for you.\n\nOnce we uncover a bit about you are, and your personal ideals and goals, it\'s time to focus on your company. What can your company do better? What is its mission? We define the expectations and build the game plan. This introductory collaboration will be the indispensable tool that will keep us on track, and give us an accurate layout to follow.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn an effort to ensure our clientsâ needs are met, Zenman puts considerable focus into research and understanding the objectives and goals of the client. Connection is everything. We believe this is achieved through clear, authentic and meaningful dialogue. During initial presentation, our staff presents a discovery document that we expect both companies to invest in mutually. This approach is critical to our ability to complete all aspects of a project, including: deadlines, marketing and advertising strategies, creative and technical briefings, design and development. Aligning organizational values and exploring compelling and innovative methods of articulation come from explosive communication. The discovery portion of the project will last 1-2 weeks.\n<h3>Unite</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Build framework for design</li>\n	<li>Decide what form our designs will need to take</li>\n	<li>Measure twice, cut once.</li>\n	<li>We layout the foundation for how they need their design so when we put in the time for the design stage, we are hitting the nail on the head every time.</li>\n	<li>What design elements work best for your company?</li>\n</ul>\nIn this stage, we take the information we uncovered, and unite it to give us a compass for the project. This is where we really focus on deciding what form our design will need to take in order to best reach your target individuals. We begin to design the design elements for the project. \"Will you need a fresh logo?\",\"What kind of media should we design for to ensure your customers find you?\", these are just a few of the questions we will answer in this creative portion of the design process. We want you to imagine the possibilities, and our artists work hard to make sure you have plenty of themÂ to choose from.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce the discovery process is complete, the information is compiled and becomes the basis of direction for the creative phase. Our artists spend time with content identification and development while working on deadline. The right solution for each clientâs unique needs can take on many, discrete forms. It might include print design, interactive design, branding, search engine optimization and viral marketing. This design process gives the client an opportunity to visualize the idea and feel comfortable with the direction of the project before any developmental work has begun. The design phase will last 3-4 weeks unless otherwise noted in the project schedule.\n<h3>Unfold</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Start developing the final project</li>\n	<li>Integrate the elements we have already built into the development</li>\n	<li>Production- Content arrangement, graphic development</li>\n	<li>Engineering</li>\n	<li>Testing</li>\n	<li>Changing</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nUpon completion of the design phase, and when a clear consensus has been achieved, Zenman\'s Denver web development begins. The development phase is the actual building of the design or application in a manner that is both loyal and honorable to our clients. Our developers utilize advanced technical expertise to develop the interactive project as efficiently and effectively as possible while working on deadline. During this phase, the project goes through many iterations including production, engineering, Alpha testing, Beta testing, etc. Throughout this process, Zenman applies a rigorous quality assurance methodology to ensure the integrity of all development work. Development will take 4-8 weeks, depending on the complexity of the web project.\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Utilize</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Final face to face meeting</li>\n	<li>Quality Assurance</li>\n	<li>Documentation Review</li>\n	<li>Analytics</li>\n	<li>Continued engagement</li>\n</ul>\nFinally, it is time for project delivery - an exciting time for our clients. Our Denver web development process has come to completion, content is frozen and the staging for our clients has been prepared to maximum potential and ready to be deployed. A meeting is scheduled to assure the satisfaction of each client, and needs have been met. More quality assurance is performed, all documentation is completed and reviewed, a pre-flight check is done and the product is launched upon deadline. After delivery and in order to track project success and client return-on-investment, Zenman uses best-practice analytics and tracking programs and techniques. To ensure continued success, Zenman and our clients continue with periodic deep engagement as needed and agreed upon in new terms. Zenman is driven to ensure that everything is delivered as requested, on time and within budget; and, above all, that our clients are pleased. The deployment phase will be one week.','Web Design','','draft','closed','open','','web','','','2014-09-22 16:50:42','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?page_id=87',0,'page','',0),(89,2,'2014-09-24 15:06:50','2014-09-24 15:06:50','<h3 class=\"widget-title\">Latest Posts</h3>\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/values/\">Values</a>','Blog','','publish','closed','open','','blog','','','2014-09-24 15:06:50','2014-09-24 15:06:50','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?page_id=89',0,'page','',0),(97,2,'2014-10-01 01:00:07','2014-10-01 01:00:07','<h1>First off,</h1>\n<h3>I want to note that this post is not meant to put down the alternatives to Google Drive. I am merely expressing my experience with the service, and a few things I did to get more out of the service.</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GoogleDriveImageForBlog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-120 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GoogleDriveImageForBlog-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"GoogleDrive\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I have been a Google Customer for a while now. I think that the first time I ever took advantage of the \"Google Drive\" before it was the cloud storage system it is today was in Gmail. All Gmail users had a certain amount of data they could use for storing email attachments and emails long term. The next time I used the service was when they introduced the Google Docs program.\n\nI upgraded to the pro version of Google Drive, after a family reunion. My aunt was asking about ways we could share family photos with everyone in out family. I immediately thought of Google Drive as a potential solution, and signed up for the 500GB version for $10 a month. I had kept it for a while, just using it as a tool for sharing photos with our family members. It wasn\'t until recently that I started using it to bridge the gap from the work I was doing at home, to the place that I would be working at the time.I don\'t want to keep ALL of my files on my computer I travel with. I want to be able to access them, but more importantly I want space on my laptop.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>The Setup</h1>\n<h2>Step 1- Clean up files</h2>\nI needed to clean up my folders a bit. This meant looking over all of the files that could be moved, and moving them to the desired location. I have three main folders, and under that I had several individual folders for clients, and personal design projects. I deleted as much as I could to leave just the things that I am working on at the time. I hate having desktop icons. I feel like it is easier to have a cluttered file system when you just drag things to the open space, and don\'t take time to put them where they belong.\n<h2>Step 2- Create a \"Temporary\" Folder</h2>\nThis folder will be synced with both computers and hold anything you only want to store locally until it can be filed away to the appropriate cloud based location. Let\'s say you have a fairly large file that you need to work on today outside of your home base. You can download the file and save any changes to the temporary folder on your home base computer, or your mobile computer. Then when you are done needing it with you on the go, you can move it from the Google Drive web interface to another folder such as the next folder we will create: The \"Cloud\" Folder.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Step 3- Create a \"Cloud\" folder</h2>\nAfter setting up a <a href=\"drive.google.com\">Google Drive</a> account, it\'s time to create your first Google Drive folder. Go to your Google Drive, and click the add new icon. Click folder and label it \"Cloud\". The purpose of this folder is to keep items that you don\'t need on either machine, but want to make sure you can access down the road. I personally don\'t use this too often, because I have plenty of space on my home machine. I do however store all of my Google Docs in it which is especially handy. I also keep a sub folder inside it that I share with family and friends who want to upload an entire photo album for everyone to see.\n<h2>Step 4- Create a Latest Work folder</h2>\nThe purpose of this folder will be to make sure you are synching only the bare necessities when you are on the go. Create it the same way you created the last folder from inside your Google Drive account. <strong>Remember: You can still access any of these files because they will be stored on Google Drive, right now we are focusing on just the folders that will be synced with your mobile computer.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Step 5- Create system specific folders</h2>\nI have one Mac Book Air for travel, and one custom built PC for work at home. You will want to have folders that are specific to the device you are working on, so that you can easily keep up with what you will need to have synced. From your Google Drive account, create folders with the name of the system they will be storing files for.\n<h2>Step 6- Installing and configuring</h2>\nAfter you have spent time organizing the files and you feel like it is as organized as it can be, it\'s time to install Drive onto all of your machines. Follow the instructions <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374989?hl=en\">here</a> that walk you through step-by-step on installing it. Windows users can click <a href=\"https://ninite.com/googledrive/\">here</a> to have it installed automatically using ninite.com. Once you have it installed, and you have signed in using your Google account info, it\'s time to choose what to synch on both machines. By default all of your folders will be synched to any machine that has Drive installed, so you will want to select only the necessary ones. To do that, pause Drive by finding it\'s icon in the system tray or menu bar. Then click on \"Preferences\" to open the window with sync settings. Click the check box that says \"Only sync some folders to this computer\", then click the check box next to the folder that needs to be synced to the machine you are working on. After these boxes have been checked, you can un-pause your drive. You should now be able to see a Google Drive folder showing up in Windows Explorer, or OSX Finder. You can expand that folder to see the other folders you have created and synched. Drag those folders to your library on the left side of the window so that you can easily access them when you need to. Once you have repeated these steps for all of the systems you need to have on the cloud, it\'s time to upload everything.\n<h2>Step 7- Uploading files</h2>\nNow that you have everything nice and neat and synced correctly, you can upload folders and files by dragging them to where they should go. If you already have an organizational system in place for your folders and files, you can move the parent folder into which ever Drive folder they should be in. Your folder hierarchy and organization will stay the same on Drive. After dragging everything to the final location, it will take some time to upload everything that needs to be uploaded.\n\nThat\'s it! You\'re ready to keep your folders backed up and secure, and hopefully clear up some space on your mobile machine.\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>If you have any cool ideas for using Google Drive, leave a comment!</h1>\nDon\'t forget to subscribe!\n\n[smlsubform prepend=\"\" showname=true nametxt=\"\" nameholder=\"Name...\" emailtxt=\"\" emailholder=\"Email Address...\" showsubmit=true submittxt=\"Subscribe\" jsthanks=false thankyou=\"Thank you for subscribing to Nic Bovee\'s blog!\"]\n\n&nbsp;','How I use Google Drive to bridge the gap from mobile to home base and beyond','','publish','open','open','','google-drive','','','2014-10-01 01:00:07','2014-10-01 01:00:07','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=97',0,'post','',0),(98,2,'2014-09-24 17:56:17','2014-09-24 17:56:17','<h2>What are some values you want to see in your life and business?</h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_99\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"210\"]<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Blog-Post-924.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-99 \" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Blog-Post-924-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Photography by Dani Austin\" width=\"210\" height=\"158\" /></a> Photography by Dani Austin[/caption]\n\nThis is a question I have been asking myself quite a bit in the past few weeks. Lately I have been working really hard to define my business\'s structure to make it as scalable as possible. This has forced me to take a look at some of my own core values and find out what the things are that get me revved up on a project or with a client. Without hitting on too many details here are some of the things I found:\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\nI thoroughly enjoy working with a team of people who all want to do something great. Getting amped up about a project with a group of people is way more enjoyable than just being a singular person who is excited about it.\n<h3>Freedom</h3>\nThis is freedom in my week to go spend time with my hobbies and family, as well as freedom to work on the things that excite me. It isn\'t always easy to find this freedom in the work that I do, but it is something I want to be intentional about getting.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Eustress</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is a term coined by <a title=\"Hans Selye\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Selye\">Hans Selye</a>, and is best described as a positive response to stress that is healthy. I don\'t want to spend my days on planet earth constantly stressing out over the things that need to be done. However I also don\'t want to have no stress at all. It pushes me to do better work. It doesn\'t let me get off the hook.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>There are a lot of methods for discovering these values for your own business, but here are a few questions that can get you started:</h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h3>What do you remember working on that gave you the most satisfaction?</h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Name a few more times when you have been truly passionate about what you were working on, then try and find the similarities between them.</h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>What are the underlying themes and similarities you noticed?</h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>What is important to you about those themes?</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>I will be back on a regular weekly posting schedule, so be sure to check out my blog next Wednesday.</h1>\n<h1>Don\'t forget to subscribe!</h1>\n[smlsubform prepend=\"\" showname=true nametxt=\"\" nameholder=\"Name...\" emailtxt=\"\" emailholder=\"Email Address...\" showsubmit=true submittxt=\"Submit\" jsthanks=false thankyou=\"Thank you for subscribing to our mailing list\"]','Values','','publish','open','open','','values','','','2014-09-24 17:56:17','2014-09-24 17:56:17','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=98',0,'post','',0),(172,2,'2014-10-07 15:43:42','2014-10-07 15:43:42','&nbsp;			<img style=\"-webkit-user-select: none\" src=\"https://multicraft.mcprohosting.com/index.php?r=status/276930.png\">\n\n<h2>Butterbyte.com is a Tekkit Survival server for anyone who is tired of constant Administrator interference.

You are the warrior.Â Today belongs to you.</h3>\nWhat makes your company different? Why do those differences matter? Who cares?\n\nAsking these questions and identifying their answers are at the core of marketing. When people see your brand or products, they make a choice. They can buy into your offering, or continue to look elsewhere. The customer\'s ability to fit your solution into their idea of a perfect world is correlated directly to how well you can set the scene.\n<h2>Analytics</h2>\nHow do you chart the success of your efforts to promote your brand? I believe that tracking numbers is a positively in-imaginative way to track your success. The relationship you have with your customer is in my opinion the best way to watch your customer base grow organically. Making an effort to improve the your customer\'s experiences and give them incentives to be happy with you as a company will result in them wanting to share those positive experiences with others.\n<h2>Â Understanding what your extraordinary customer looks like</h2>\nAt this point in time, your company probably has a fair number of satisfied customers. Each of these customers offer key insights on what your average customers like and don\'t like. Work on finding out what these customers want. Don\'t use surveys that flood their inbox and end up in the trash. Make an effort to build profiles for them when you interact with them. When they work with your customer support, listen and note all of the personal elements of their lives. After collecting the data, focus on the out liars. The people that seem out of place may actually be a tip of a beautiful iceberg waiting for discovery.\n<h2>Â Company Identity</h2>\nHow many of your customers know your mission statement? How many can recognize your offering just because it fits within your mission statement? I don\'t care how boring you think your company is. If you believe in what you are doing, your customer should to. The belief starts with an understanding of the simple concept that is your business. The simpler the concept the more likely your customers are to remember it for a long time.','Communicating the value of you, to your customer','','publish','closed','open','','marketing','','','2015-03-09 17:21:08','2015-03-09 17:21:08','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?page_id=276',0,'page','',0),(282,2,'2015-03-11 07:51:11','2015-03-11 07:51:11','<h1><a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nics-21st-Birthday-Invite-Baskerville.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-288\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nics-21st-Birthday-Invite-Baskerville.jpg\" alt=\"Nic\'s-21st-Birthday-Invite-Baskerville\" width=\"2124\" height=\"1524\" /></a>Hi there,</h1>\n<h4>Â I am Nic Bovee, but you probably already knew that because if you received this link I consider you one of my closest friends and enjoy your companionship.

That\'s impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth. Then you\'ll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.â</b>\n\nAs you read these words, your mind is busily processing each word into something that has meaning to you. If I didnât bring it up, you most likely wouldnât be considering the miracle that the electrical pulses in my head were converted into words, sent to my fingertips, converted into electrical signals sent to the computer through an infinitely complex set of protocols and mediums, then re-converted again to text and mapped out onto the millions of tiny lights on your monitor. You may also feel compelled to read this post for one reason or another, and right now Iâd like to ask you to consider moving on to the next post, or thing you have as an option in front of you. By choosing something other than what you see as your âcurrent activityâ, especially if it is something really ludicrous you have effectively <b>destroyed your frame</b>.\n\nThe frame is a helpful tool for recognizing the subconscious assumptions you make about every single aspect of your life. By recognizing the frame, you are shedding light on line that all opportunity stands behind, gazing longingly in at the fluff lucky enough to make it into the limelight. That fluff is inside of your frame for one simple reason. You want it there. It is the thing or things that resonated with your emotions causing you to quickly form the assumption that it deserves your attention. It is the fluff that makes a decision difficult. It is time to wake up to the reality. Outside of the small canvas of options you have painted within the frame of your decision, lies a gallery rife with even better options that werenât even allowed onto your paint brush. Destroy your frame. Tear it off of the wall and embrace the world of possibilities that lie in front of you. Unplug from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwq7b2i-vc\">the Matrix</a> youâve created for yourself and see whatâs really available for you. Time is of the essence, so now that youâve emerged on the other side, take a deep breath. Letâs make a decision.\n<h5>It starts with the change agent. A problem that needs solving.</h5>\nA person came into a computer shop I worked at and asked the question: âShould I buy a Mac? I hear they are a lot easier to use and my PC has been running so slow.â What is this personâs problem? What change agent caused them to start a decision process in the first place?\n\nThat is when the Apple elitist in me screams: âDuh, theyâre on a freaking PC, of course itâs slow and frustrating!â. Ladies and Gentleman I present in all of its narrow minded glory, a frame. You may not see the danger, but imagine me giving that person information based on what my frame of their problem says the obvious choice is. Itâs just plain foolish to set one option on a scale without a counter option to balance it out and come to a reasonable, educated decision. Itâs time to destroy the frame and rebuild it around options that matter. Here is how we do it:\n<h3><strong>Ask off the wall questions-</strong></h3>\nHow educated is she when it comes to PC? How long has she had her PC? Could she do more of the things that she finds frustrating on the PC in a more familiar environment? Does she have any friends that she can borrow a Mac from to ensure that she isnât switching to something that will have a learning curve? How do they like living in Colorado? What is their favorite television show?What is the price difference between a low end Mac and a high end PC? You get the picture. Make cases for both sides of the argument. Pose as many questions as possible and donât be afraid of the questions that donât seem to have any relation to the problem.\n<h3><strong>Trash the options your frame dealt you-</strong></h3>\nIn most cases while confronting a decision, our frame usually submits a few ideas for consideration. Throw them out of the equation all together. This leaves you with one problem and zero solutions. Innovate. If that option wasnât available how then could we solve the problem. Switching to Mac isnât an option, and this person desperately needs to feel less frustrated when using a PC. What about switching to Linux? Or not using a computer at all? It seems that innovation is usually brought into existence because it is demanded. Demand innovation. Paint the frame, then the gallery, then demolish the gallery, and force yourself to migrate your art onto the hull of a spaceship.\n<h3><strong>Consider the opportunity cost-</strong></h3>\nIf one of their options is to spend a minimum of $700 on a Mac, could that money be used to solve the problem using a different option? Â What is the opportunity cost of all of your options. What opportunity are you giving up to make the current option you are considering?\n\nNow assess the options. Borrow Mac from a friend and evaluate it for 10 dayâs. Become more familiar with working in a PC environment(unfortunately this does mean learning a thing or two about basic maintenance). Start working through options to ease into the decision. Try the cheapest options first and consider setting a timeline that tells you when you will take the plunge.\n\nNow build a new frame, the proper frame your new set of options deserve.Start to strategically migrate the options that seem least likely to solve the original problem to the outside, and sit back and appreciate the different features of each option you now have in front of you.\n\nLeft with a handful of reasonable options, including ones that you may have never considered, it is time to decide.\n<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>\n<strong>Framing is usually done without unconsciously, which means it relies on our deeper self, and does not provide a platform for our better options to breathe. We must destroy that frame and rebuild it around a set of options that includes the options that fell into the crowd of ideas that got instantly shoved aside when the problem presented itself.</strong>\n\n<strong>Ask any question that pops into your head to try and get some off the wall ideas and solutions for handling the problem.</strong>\n\n<strong>Take the obvious solution out of the picture all together and ask a new question such as: â If solution x canât happen, what can I do instead to solve problem y?â</strong>\n\n<strong>Consider the opportunity cost: âWhat value would one decision give that another one wouldnât?â</strong>\n<h4>BONUS: How does this apply to the educational system?</h4>\nFrame: Students must be tested and graded in order to ensure that they are learning, and that our teachers are doing their jobs.\n\nWhat problem is this solving? We donât know if kids are learning, and if the teacher is doing their job.\n<h4>Off the wall questions-</h4>\nWho is the educational system for, the kids or the administrative board?\n\nWhy are schools all inside?\n\nWhy does every kid need to go to school?\n\nWhat are they really getting from it?\n\nWhat does the grading system measure?\n\nWho benefits most from the grading system?\n<h4>Remove the current solution all together-</h4>\nIn a school with no grading system how would teachers know that their students understand the material?\n\nGive smaller tests on each subject and find out where kids are struggling and frame their concepts differently so they might have a better chance to understand the material.\n\nAllow kids to work at their own pace and put more emphasis on challenging them to try new things.\n<h4>Opportunity Cost-</h4>\nWhat could the money that goes into testing and grading be used for?\n\nIt is estimated that 1.7 billion dollars is spent on testing every year which could easily be used to implement better programs that support learning.\n\nBy not grading, the teachers have more time to spend working with kids ensuring that they donât need help understanding the various concepts.\n\nTo read more about this issue be sure to check out my friend <a href=\"https://altmba.com/sethperler/how-to-make-good-decisions-about-standardized-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sethâs post</a>.','Day 2 of the altMBA','','publish','closed','open','','day-2-of-the-altmba','','','2015-06-17 06:58:14','2015-06-17 06:58:14','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=329',0,'post','',0),(337,2,'2015-06-19 03:25:17','2015-06-19 03:25:17','<a href=\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\"><img src=\"http://boozedandinfused.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dsc07207.jpg\" /></a>&nbsp;<h3>Goals.

be life changing for you as long as you fight the resistance and ship religiously.\n\nYou were all drawn here for different reasons, but you are all presentÂ now because you have placedÂ a value on taking a leap into the unknown. This will be some of your hardest work, and will propel you beyond the limitations you have hit in the past. Here are a few things too help you as you begin this journey.\n\n<strong>Be empathetic.</strong> Look at the world through the eyes of the people you are meeting. You may not always agree with them, but you can always make an effort to understand their side of the story.\n\n<strong>Be vulnerable.</strong> Itâs difficult to do because we are all accustomed to a world stuffed with trolls who have nothing better to do than Â put you down. Thatâs not what this environment is for. This is an ecosystem of love and creativity. It is a place for the misfits who dared to dream of something greater. Do your best to help everyone elseâs dreams come true.\n\n<strong>Jump.</strong> Take the plunge. Dare to speak up. Offer help when people need it. Be bold in your writing. Donât be afraid to create beyond the program. Be the first. Push everything out of the way in order to ship\n\nBe like Amazon. Ship on time. Exceed expectations. Love your people.

Check out the video, he starts singing about 5 minutes in.</p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpfoRludBmU&#038;feature=youtu.be\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpfoRludBmU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><h1>Project 1 from the altMBA</h1><p>Project 1 gave us a chance to work together as a team to explain a good decision making process by understanding:</p><p>Frames</p><p>Decision Trees</p><p>Priorities</p><p>Sunk Costs</p><p>All of these are very important when it comes to making a decision.Â </p><p>Â </p><h2>This is how I chose to explain framing:</h2><p><a href=\"http://altmba.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Destroy-your-frame.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2400 \" src=\"http://altmba.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Destroy-your-frame-1024x655.gif\" alt=\"Destroy-your-frame\" width=\"488\" height=\"312\" /></a></p><p>âDo not try and bend the spoon. That\'s impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth. Then you\'ll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.â</p><p>As you read these words, your mind is busily processing each word into something that has meaning to you. If I didnât bring it up, you most likely wouldnât be considering the miracle that the electrical pulses in my head were converted into words, sent to my fingertips, converted into electrical signals sent to the computer through an infinitely complex set of protocols and mediums, then re-converted again to text and mapped out onto the millions of tiny lights on your monitor. You may also feel compelled to read this post for one reason or another, and right now Iâd like to ask you to consider moving on to the next post, or thing you have as an option in front of you. By choosing something other than what you see as your âcurrent activityâ, especially if it is something really ludicrous you have effectively destroyed your frame.</p><p>The frame is a helpful tool for recognizing the subconscious assumptions you make about every single aspect of your life. By recognizing the frame, you are shedding light on line that all opportunity stands behind, gazing longingly in at the fluff lucky enough to make it into the limelight. That fluff is inside of your frame for one simple reason. You want it there. It is the thing or things that resonated with your emotions causing you to quickly form the assumption that it deserves your attention. It is the fluff that makes a decision difficult. It is time to wake up to the reality. Outside of the small canvas of options you have painted within the frame of your decision, lies a gallery rife with even better options that werenât even allowed onto your paint brush. Destroy your frame. Tear it off of the wall and embrace the world of possibilities that lie in front of you. Unplug from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwq7b2i-vc\">the Matrix</a> youâve created for yourself and see whatâs really available for you. Time is of the essence, so now that youâve emerged on the other side, take a deep breath. Letâs make a decision.</p><h5>It starts with the change agent. A problem that needs solving.</h5><p>A person came into a computer shop I worked at and asked the question: âShould I buy a Mac? I hear they are a lot easier to use and my PC has been running so slow.â What is this personâs problem? What change agent caused them to start a decision process in the first place?</p><p>That is when the Apple elitist in me screams: âDuh, theyâre on a freaking PC, of course itâs slow and frustrating!â. Ladies and Gentleman I present in all of its narrow minded glory, a frame. You may not see the danger, but imagine me giving that person information based on what my frame of their problem says the obvious choice is. Itâs just plain foolish to set one option on a scale without a counter option to balance it out and come to a reasonable, educated decision. Itâs time to destroy the frame and rebuild it around options that matter. Here is how we do it:</p><h3><strong>Ask off the wall questions-</strong></h3><p>How educated is she when it comes to PC? How long has she had her PC? Could she do more of the things that she finds frustrating on the PC in a more familiar environment? Does she have any friends that she can borrow a Mac from to ensure that she isnât switching to something that will have a learning curve? How do they like living in Colorado? What is their favorite television show?What is the price difference between a low end Mac and a high end PC? You get the picture. Make cases for both sides of the argument. Pose as many questions as possible and donât be afraid of the questions that donât seem to have any relation to the problem.</p><h3><strong>Trash the options your frame dealt you-</strong></h3><p>In most cases while confronting a decision, our frame usually submits a few ideas for consideration. Throw them out of the equation all together. This leaves you with one problem and zero solutions. Innovate. If that option wasnât available how then could we solve the problem. Switching to Mac isnât an option, and this person desperately needs to feel less frustrated when using a PC. What about switching to Linux? Or not using a computer at all? It seems that innovation is usually brought into existence because it is demanded. Demand innovation. Paint the frame, then the gallery, then demolish the gallery, and force yourself to migrate your art onto the hull of a spaceship.</p><h3><strong>Consider the opportunity cost-</strong></h3><p>If one of their options is to spend a minimum of $700 on a Mac, could that money be used to solve the problem using a different option? Â What is the opportunity cost of all of your options. What opportunity are you giving up to make the current option you are considering?</p><p>Now assess the options. Borrow Mac from a friend and evaluate it for 10 dayâs. Become more familiar with working in a PC environment(unfortunately this does mean learning a thing or two about basic maintenance). Start working through options to ease into the decision. Try the cheapest options first and consider setting a timeline that tells you when you will take the plunge.</p><p>Now build a new frame, the proper frame your new set of options deserve.Start to strategically migrate the options that seem least likely to solve the original problem to the outside, and sit back and appreciate the different features of each option you now have in front of you.</p><p>Left with a handful of reasonable options, including ones that you may have never considered, it is time to decide.</p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4><p><strong>Framing is usually done without unconsciously, which means it relies on our deeper self, and does not provide a platform for our better options to breathe. We must destroy that frame and rebuild it around a set of options that includes the options that fell into the crowd of ideas that got instantly shoved aside when the problem presented itself.</strong></p><p><strong>Ask any question that pops into your head to try and get some off the wall ideas and solutions for handling the problem.</strong></p><p><strong>Take the obvious solution out of the picture all together and ask a new question such as: â If solution x canât happen, what can I do instead to solve problem y?â</strong></p><p><strong>Consider the opportunity cost: âWhat value would one decision give that another one wouldnât?â</strong></p><h4>BONUS: How does this apply to the educational system?</h4><p>Frame: Students must be tested and graded in order to ensure that they are learning, and that our teachers are doing their jobs.</p><p>What problem is this solving? We donât know if kids are learning, and if the teacher is doing their job.</p><h4>Off the wall questions-</h4><p>Who is the educational system for, the kids or the administrative board?</p><p>Why are schools all inside?</p><p>Why does every kid need to go to school?</p><p>What are they really getting from it?</p><p>What does the grading system measure?</p><p>Who benefits most from the grading system?</p><h4>Remove the current solution all together-</h4><p>In a school with no grading system how would teachers know that their students understand the material?</p><p>Give smaller tests on each subject and find out where kids are struggling and frame their concepts differently so they might have a better chance to understand the material.</p><p>Allow kids to work at their own pace and put more emphasis on challenging them to try new things.</p><h4>Opportunity Cost-</h4><p>What could the money that goes into testing and grading be used for?</p><p>It is estimated that 1.7 billion dollars is spent on testing every year which could easily be used to implement better programs that support learning.</p><p>By not grading, the teachers have more time to spend working with kids ensuring that they donât need help understanding the various concepts.</p><p>To read more about this issue be sure to check out my friend <a href=\"https://altmba.com/sethperler/how-to-make-good-decisions-about-standardized-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">Sethâs post</a>.</p><p>About this project: This is post 2/5 on Project 1 of altMBA.

It\'s been awesome to hear all of the great feedback! I think that one of the most common critiques was on the weakness of the article towards the end. I think that there are three ways to approach an issue of lack luster content.</p><p>1. When you start to feel like the content you are producing is weak and not enjoyable to write, scrap it and move on to something that is.</p><p>2.Read each sentence carefully to find out which sentence is the most boring, then ditch those select sentences.</p><p>3.Re-read the paper as Ryon mentioned and come up with an idea of how it sounds.</p><p>I\'ve also concluded that the bonus section couldÂ either be done away with, setup as an additional example, or moved into a separate post.</p><p>If I were to re-write this post, I would condense it by chopping out my own fluff that I felt like I needed to satisfy the project. What I have to say is only important if people are awake long enough to read it.</p><p>In order to practice what I preach starting now:</p><p>That\'s it.

You donât seem to really like it at all. Your friends see it. People you work with see it. The people you save when you are living in your callingÂ see it too. Why canât you embrace it? What worldly threat is holding you back from living as superman all of the time?</p><h6>To be Clark Kent and brush your calling to the side, is to deny yourself time spent operating as the creature you were intended to be.</h6><p>It is time to sell the bullshit you bought, and start to work with what you were given. Youâve got no time to lose! Imagine a life where you wake up excited for the day and you have trouble going to sleep because your day was filled to the brim with people and experiences worth having again, and again. What does your day look like?</p><p>Hurrah! If you can search inside yourself and identify the answer, congratulations! Youâve now fertilized the catalyst of a very long journey ahead. It is going to be a very challenging several months, and there will be plenty of complications. However, it will pay off. Your body now roams the planet conscious of its one purpose: Deliver this beautiful, previously unknown part of myself into the world, and walk with it through its incredible life ahead.</p><h4><strong>Set your goals.</strong></h4><p><strong>Conceive the dream.</strong> Carry it through its development. Release it into the world kicking, screaming, and smashing through the barriers that were put in place before its conception.</p><p><strong>What do those barriers look like?</strong></p><p><strong>What must you learn along the way?</strong></p><p><strong>Who needs to be apart of your support circle?</strong></p><p>Finally, <strong>set its due date!</strong> You are an excited new parent and canât wait to meet your child.</p><p>Rejoice when it comes to fruition, breathes the air of the earth and can be remarked on by others fortunate enough to meet it.</p><p>My name is Nic Bovee. I dream of a life spent helping entities bigger than myself with a team of people who always challenge the status quo. My goal is to rely less on my position as Clark Kent, and dare to fly into the unknown as the super hero I was placed on earth to be. I love being asked questions I donât know the answer to. I love to collaborate with a team of people who enjoy the same. It would be so refreshing to operate with a team of âA+â players who donât allow me to stay tucked away in the safe bowels of my comfort zone. The path to living my dream comes with many adversaries. The biggest challenge being the mentality I have created for myself.</p><p>â You cannot survive on your own!â</p><p>âYouâre not smart enough! â</p><p>âYou depend on other people to live! â</p><p>Pushing against those barriers until my newly achieved goal can break through them is going to be almost impossible. Itâs going to take a lifestyle that permits learning, and developing new things while still functioning safely in the company. It will take me stepping out and assembling a team of people who are the best in the world at what they do. It will take my vulnerability to step out and actively look for the bigger entities that have problems that our elite team can solve for them.</p><p>My plan of action is this.</p><p>Start now. Reach out to the people in my existing circle and find out if they want to be apart of something like this. Start acting like a company, and set deadlines for the projects Iâm already involved in. Learn how to pay taxes like a company. Tune in to what it is I actually do on the team, and pitch it to the people who I want to work with.</p><p><strong>My Deadline</strong></p><p>June 15th 2016-It is the one-year anniversary of the day I started the most important transformation of my life. I will be spending an equal portion of my time during the week meeting with my team and talking through the current challenges our firm faces. My price structure will be fully developed as a piece of art. I will have at minimum 5 projects at a time, and will be actively networking to gain at least 5 more for the next month. We will ship on time. We will ship great work. I will have learned new things from the 50+ books I add to my library. Most importantly, I will be shedding new light on my current job and hopefully applying some of the concepts from my company into the weaknesses of the one I work for. Itâs not going to be easy, and Iâll need to constantly monitor the course and change as need be.</p><p>Creating all of this will be worth it. When I reach the top I will have brought along stories that either tell of the bounty of success or the lessons from a successful failure.</p><h3><strong>P.S.</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of my article, I was really leaving an opening or invitation for readers to join in and set some goals of their own. I left the door open, but never told anyone to go in. As <strong><a href=\"https://altmba.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=post&amp;author=133\">Seth Perler</a></strong> pointed out, I should make a point of letting the reader know that there is an opportunity and to get the most out of my article they should take it.</p><h4><strong>Updated Plan of action- Upon Michelleâs request</strong></h4><p><strong>Restate my goal (With meat):</strong></p><p>I want to live a life where I work with companies that want to push themselves to a new level of greatness by helping them make decisions on the creative front. This includes:</p><p><strong>Branding</strong>- Designing the story behind the image, then updating the image to reflect the story. I want to design a workflow that will ask the questions that need to be asked in order to discover what the companyâs story is.</p><p><strong>Logo Design</strong>- Whether itâs a redesign for branding or a start to finish creation, my goal is to be a company that takes the culture of a company, and creates a logo for them. Iâve done this for a few different people, and Iâve really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Web Site Design</strong>- This is definitely an element of my structure that will require looking for a great developer who can work with me on developing a strategic method of laying out a site in order to provide an easy experience that doesnât feel âbrokenâ.</p><p><strong>Customer Relationship Design</strong>- Most small companies I talk to donât care about the actual relationship that they have with their customers. It sucks because they miss out on such an awesome opportunity to make the customer want to keep coming back for more than just the product that they sell.</p><p><strong>Customer Experience Design</strong>- From start to finish, I want to build the street that a customer walks down when they use that company. This has a lot to do with Sethâs Purple Cow concept, as well as tribes. It think that most companies leave the community out of it. What needs to happen is a new focus on doing things that wow the customer. Zappos had free 2 day shipping as something they did to upgrade the customerâs order from free standard shipping. Sweetwater sends smarties with musical widget they send. I want to evaluate the customer experience by having people go through the entire interaction with the company, and come up with a list of things the loved and things they disliked.</p><p><strong>Value Development</strong>- Work on actual projects the customer is working on to offer insight on how they can add even more value to what they are offering by means of adding a few features, or simply revising the way they pitch the product. This process will rely heavily on the information we have from the strong customer relationships and using it to offer something that speaks to them.</p><p><strong>Company Structure Design</strong>- This first came from an experience I had as general manager of a computer shop. This involves looking at the internal workflow. I want to look at what the business does internally and help them find a better way to accomplish more things, faster! I think that itâs difficult to see the inefficiency if you are used to looking at it every day. We come in and identify the top things that could change in one week that would help a company be more efficient in the way that it runs and handles itself.</p><h4><strong>Pushing against the obstacles</strong></h4><p><strong>Who will I reach out to?</strong></p><p>Two groups of people</p><p><strong>Internal</strong>- People I know personally who would be a lot of help and want to be a part of this company or know people who might. The smaller goal here is to build a team of people that expand the diversity of the promises we can make to our customers. By knowing the people apart of this, we can make promises and exceed them to provide our customers with an exceptional experience</p><p>People from internal are filling certain roles of the kind of experience our group wants to create:</p><p>WebÂ Â Â Â Â  MarketingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Internal StructureÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  EducationÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DevelopersÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Graphics Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â BrandingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Value Development</p><p>Jon Dale- Close personal friend and the reason Iâm aware of Seth Godin and in the altMBA</p><p>Todd A. - Web</p><p>Justin L. - Social Marketing</p><p>Andy T. â Develop the network</p><p>Josh K. â Learning materials</p><p>Kevin M. â Becoming an entrepreneur vs. a free lancer</p><p>Stephen D. â Developer connections</p><p>Jason R. â Developer connections</p><p>Brooke B. â Marketing</p><p><strong>External</strong>- Companies that have people in them who want to make the company more than just a Car dealership. More than just a coffee shop. More than an okay place to go buy jewelry. Places that are used to dealing with pricy corporate establishments that use the same methods they have used for the last 20 years to offer a solution of one facet of the customers problem. I want to start small with people I have already worked with and know, offering new value that their company can begin to implement, until I have a method I can start to practice on a bigger company.</p><p>The PC Shop</p><p>G1 Equip</p><p>MakeExerciseEasy</p><p>Recycles</p><p>DTG</p><p>CreativeIvoryMusic</p><p>Moutain Scoops</p><p>Team TeleCycle</p><p>Jives</p><h4>Why will they want to be a part of what Iâm doing?</h4><p><strong>Internal</strong>- Not all of them will be a part of it directly, but they may point me in the direction of people who will want to be part of it directly. I think that if I am connected with the right people, the idea of scheduling time to collaborate and sharing contracts with people who are the best at what they do will be an attractive offer for people who may be wasting their time at a job they get nothing from.</p><p><strong>External-</strong>I believe that when presented with an opportunity to invigorate the working environment and increase their exposure to people who care, as well as overall productivity and financial performance. I see it as them making the decision to hire a life coach that helps the company find what it wants just as much as it helps the employees.</p><h4><strong>What will I ask specifically?</strong></h4><p>Internal- Why do you do what you do? If their passionate I want to connect them with the companies that are passionate.</p><h4><strong>What is the project they are actually joining?</strong></h4><p>That varies based on the client. Some of my clients have wanted minimal changes to be made on one page of their site. Others have had me re design their logo and analyze their business structure.</p><h4>How will I specifically act like a company?</h4><p>Stephen Pressfield brought up the idea of meeting with yourself weekly. Thanks Stephen! I want to meet on a week by week basis and set goals for my âCompanyâ as if I already had the accountability of people who were waiting for me to give them a project to do.Â  I also want to spend time developing my whole business model, to understand what kind of company it is that Iâm really describing.</p><h4><strong>List the projects that need deadlines.</strong></h4><p>Current projects that need deadlines are all web based projects. I am rotten liar to myself. I tell myself that I donât have time to spend on the project. Wrong. I will start by setting a dead line to have a fully written Web Design questionnaire by next Wednesday.</p><h4><strong>How will I learn to pay taxes like a company?</strong></h4><p>This is one that Iâm hoping I can find info on from my cohort or the altMBA family. I think it will be quite a while before I can hire a book keeper or CPA. What book can I read that will teach me how to manage an LLC in terms of taxes, and not get screwed over.</p><h4><strong>What is that you want to do? How will you pitch it?</strong></h4><p>Iâm passionate about many things, but there are two things that out-weigh the rest. Design, and people.</p><p>I love to see and understand why things were created the way they were. When I can afford to do it without debt, I will go to college for design both industrial, and graphic. The thing that I really love looking at is details, and in this job I get to explore details in almost every aspect of my favorite hobby: business. I also love people. I want to create something that is as much a community as it is a company. A place for creatives. These creatives might be paying the community, or they might be getting paid. We all are passionate about building plan Z first and shipping a day early than we were expected.</p>','Starting','','publish','closed','open','','superman','','','2015-07-20 00:06:13','2015-07-20 00:06:13','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=395',0,'post','',0),(399,2,'2015-07-21 01:21:20','2015-07-21 01:21:20','<a href=\"http://youtu.be/0bZCjIVlx4g\">http://youtu.be/0bZCjIVlx4g</a><p>Â </p><h1>Today I finished my<a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/freeprize/2012/05/the-shipit-journal-now-in-free-pdf-format.html\"> Ship It Journal</a>.Â </h1><h2>I am committed to putting on my live event, and I will stop at nothing to make it happen.

A network connecting homeschoolers, unschoolers, people who are not enrolled in traditional schooling so they can help each other. There is a great need for these folks to get guidance to fill in the gaps with educating their kids. Many do not have education backgrounds and become overwhelmed.Micro schooling - An idea for a new type of school that is community run. A structure for how to implement it, completely nontraditional, creative, free, open. Let the design of these schools be driven by this question: What would be the coolest way in the world to create a school that best empowers learners to make their dent in the universe?Strength school - What if there was a school that was designed to build upon the strengths of the students? What if the teachers were skilled at helping students create and execute projects that were personally meaningful? What if students learned to execute projects, including all steps, from ideas to creation? This is not about perfection, it is about trying to build things that have purpose to the student. These things would require multiple disciplines and the teachers would serve as guides and mentors to walk students through the disciplines as well as managing the projects. There are no grades because it is not about compliance. There are self evaluations and evaluation meetings with mentors.Teacher coworking- Creating a coworking space for teachers who are NOT employed by schools but still want to teach, they teach homeschool classes, unschool, etc their way, for their pay. New paradigm based on the idea that teachers are artists and should be empowered to develop their craft rather than depend on following curriculum designed by big business. Teachers are seen and treated as professionals. What if there was a place where teachers could work together, inspire each other, support each other. What if teacher could develop their craft, set their own goals, build their own microbusinesses? What if there was a place where people could bring their kids, choose their classes, choose their teachers, do projects that are meaningful to the kids? What if teachers were trained to, rather than follow the curriculum prescription, they were trained to develop their strengths as teachers? What if teachers choose what classes to teach based on their passions and expertise? What if teachers made their own schedules? What if parents and teachers were empowered to collaborate in building the most engaging courses possible, as partners? What is these teachers were âfreelanceâ teachers? Itâs a new way to approach education. What if there were various classroom configurations and sizes that teachers could use to plan their expeditions with all materials you could possibly need?Education coach training - Teach people to become education coaches. Educational coaching is a brand new field that helps struggling students who donât fit into the proverbial box, navigate the outdated system effectively. It holistically helps with advocacy, executive function issues, social issues, emotional issues, academics, study skills, etc..Gap life - A business that guides kids through how to have life-changing gap years. Many kids are not ready for college but go straight after high school. An increasing number of kids are following Europeâs lead and taking gap years, years where they can have other experiences working, traveling, serving, etc.. This business would help families map out and execute safe and enriching experiences tailored to an individualâs strengths, interests, talents, values and passions.Festival - So many people want to reform education. Iâm not speaking about the corporate reformers! Noooooo, I mean other people who are itching to see change. What if there was an Educatio disrupt festival with bands, celebrities with learning disabilities, celebrating strengths, talents, and other things that aren\'t measured on tests??? What if it was constructed so that changemakers were speakers, if it was fun, if it empowered people to collaborate on small and large projects they could take back to their communities or on a bigger level? What if smaller changemakers came together to make NOISE so we can get education moving in a better direction much sooner!Student advocacy business - A problem I see all the time is that parents and their kids often do not have the tools or knowhow to advocate effectively. This business would consist of a few advocates who help families advocate in any and all ways necessary. They would help students learn to self-advocate. They would help parents know how to advocate by phone, email and in-person. They would advocate by supporting parents in the 4 main types of meetings; 504, IEP, RTI and conferences. They would help parents understand their rights and help them know when legal intervention is needed.A different type of service project - What if every school in developed countries had sibling schools or sibling projects. WHat if these were service based relationships? WHat if both sibling schools asked the other what they need and each year these communities tried to create something the other needed? What would these experiences do to help kids feel a part of a global community? How would these experiences of service influence how students think about the world? Itâs not about the project, itâs about the process.Build your own curriculum app for homeschoolers- that starts with what you want to learn and helps you implement it. Many homeschoolers donât have the experience to develop curriculum creatively or to know if they are covering all the bases. This would have questions the user would answer in relation to topics of study and it would build for them a framework they can adapt to their situation with suggestions.kid.safe.social.com - A premium, highly regulated social networking site that is 100% safe for kids. Extensive application process, fee based, geared towards dif ages, etc.. So parents KNOW their kids are safe online. This idea can be applied to a Kidsafe browser - premium browser managed by the company to guarantee kidsafe browsing. Eliminates the need for blockers and such. Could also be a Kidsafe laptop or phone.Executive function app: Executive function is the single most important concept for parents and teachers to understand if they are to help outside-the-box learners who are not meeting âpotentialâ. Unfortunately, the literature on EF is not in layman\'s terms and people who think they understand it do not. What if there was an app with an assessment that then explained your EF style and things you could do to develop it? Game changer.Yoga coworking - A coworking space for yoga teachers (and the like) to mastermind, help each other grow as entrepreneurs, etc.. They could rent various sizes of spaces so they can create programming that they profit from. This empowers the little guy. It helps them learn the biz of yoga - Teaching yoga teachers how to be entrepreneurs so they arenât slaves to the imbalanced system that keeps them poor.Build a guitar kit - Many guitarists come to a point where they want to take a stab at building a guitar. There are many ways to do this, there are companies that sell the individual parts, there are luthiers you can learn from, but after 25 years of playing, I have never seen a kit that walks a person through the entire process of building their own guitars.Flat rate airline - What if there was an airline that had flat rates? What if you went to their website and knew exactly how much it costs for various aspects of the service? No manipulating prices, no games, just honest and clarity regarding pricing.Bike microchip - Bike theft is a huge issue in many areas. A bike microchip could help locate stolen or lost bikes. The microchip could go down the frame and could be adhered permSmart camera - Many people want to become ârealâ photographers. In other words, they want to learn to use the manual settings on a camera. You can take classes and such, but what if there was a real dslr camera that taught you how to use the manual settings, that walked you through it step by step, shot by shot. You could use the guidance or just shoot, but the camera is designed to give you the knowledge necessary to master these powerful tools.A new take on healthcare - Huge problems with the healthcare system, whatâs the solution? Perhaps a biz that vets indie health and wellness providers to insurance companies.Cancer advocates - A small company who seeks to to deal with the red tape that cancer patients deal with. They would do the research on the difficult questions, talk to the doctors, provide the client with an UNBIASED person on the side of the patient to help navigate a scary and confusing medical and insurance world.Homeless camp - Many of the homeless choose the lifestyle. The police are constantly looking for their âcampsâ and forcing them to âmove on.â They donât have anywhere to move on to. What if there was a âcampâ that was designated as a safe place, a community area that supported the homeless?Fun.eral.com - We put the FUN in Funeral. For people who want to design their own funeral, particularly as a celebration of their lives. This would be a company who empowers the dying to design their ideal funeral in a celebratory manner, based on their wishes and values. Of course there would be support for people to go through their own grief process in a healthy manner. This does not in any way seek to make fun of or make light of the real need for healthy processing of grief. Â But the point is that it breaks the status quo and allows people to choose a ceremony that is personally meaningful.Marijuana dependency help - I live in Colorado, and as the marijuana legalization is changing the business landscape, more and more people are experiencing difficulties with Marijuana dependency. More people are wanting help with these issues, and as the marijuana industry grows, itâs likely that the need for help with these issues will grow as well.Prison inmate support - What if there was a company who empowered inmates to contribute to a book that goes to prisons and gives inmates an option to send their thoughts to other parts in the world. What if Ex-cons who turned it around were paid to go back into the prisons and teach inmates how to make it back in the world?Custom in-ear headphones - Headphones often come with a few sizes of the rubber pieces that are inserted in the ear, and none of them ever seem to fit right. What if you could take a cast of your ear safely, ship it to the company and they made custom noise cancelling headphones for your ear!Lyme Disease Network - Lyme disease is a quickly growing problem, particularly in the Northeast. No longer can you get a tick without worrying if it carried Lyme. This disease has profound effects on the people who have it, from aches and pains to a debilitating lack of energy. Unfortunately, the word is spreading slowly for various reasons. This business would be a social networking site that educated and connected. THere would be a section with major articles, links to specialists, and other needed resources in one place.Sober nightclub - What if there was a clean and sober nightclub with music, comedy, entertainment for people who do not want to be around all the alcohol and drugs?Rugged Camp- A choose your own adventure experience<p>Resources-Big Company Resources.</p><p>This is a camp for doing burly, rugged things.

For those living outside of prison walls, this project is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the minds and hearts of those cast aside by our society, those deemed unworthy of giving and receiving love--that which every single human being so intensely yearns for and the only thing that liberates us from both literal and figurative bondage.The first phase of the project is a Â collection of interviews with people who have seen themselves at their worst, who have been able to turn their darkness into light, who have overcome inner or outer adversity. To create a global cultural and historic context for these confessions, the interviews will be woven between some of the worldâs most poignant wisdom on the subject of the human condition and the purpose of a human life. The book will be filled with illustrations by tattoo and graffiti artists, genres of art often dismissed by our culture as vulgar, rather than the modern masterpieces they often are. For every copy sold, another copy will be donated to a prisoner.Available Resources:Grant opportunitiesWe approached a prison in Arizona and South Carolina who have creative writing programs for their prisoners.We were able to connect with psychotherapist Jenny Phillips begins intensive meditation retreats for inmates at a maximum-security prison in rural Alabama.Micro Business Plan:What problem are we solving?The time criminals spend behind bars could be used to train them the skills and positive living habits necessary for them to make a positive contribution to society, yet unfortunately they are Â Â have Â is a severly under-acknowledgingOur hope is that the first book will aide in creating an environment in prison culture where inmates have the freedom for contemplation, and artistic expression.

The second phase of the project is another book--a compilation of these responses, similarly placed in a cultural and historical context and illustrated by tattoo and graffiti artists. pression, and supportive dialogue with one another about their process of personal growth and discovery.And for whom?Readers who want to be inspiredFor those living outside of prison walls, this project is an opportunity to get a glimpse into the minds and hearts of those cast aside by our society,How?We found a local artisan who creates handmade books and replaces the pages with blank sheets.

Artify.it - A subscription-based business model developed so local artists can ârentâ their artwork to subscribers creating a consistent revenue stream for the artist and mitigating the fear people tend to associate with purchasing artwork in a public setting.Where ? We start an artist co-op started in an underserved community where property values are low, but the potential is high for revitalization.The create their art wherever they like. In a communal area that is adjoining a gallery, at home, . The work can be displayed for the public in the gallery... a local restaurant, anywhere art can be displayed and easily removed. Patronâs can pay a subscription costs of $25 per piece, per month, with a recurring monthly subscription. The gallery could also present an option for a year long contract commitment at a discounted price. Anytime a buyer wants to exchange his current piece for a new one, they simply visit the gallery and exchange it. If they keep it past a certain time, (based on appraised value) it then becomes their painting. Think Redbox.The customer segments include local restaurants and businesses that need to decorate their businesses, real estate agents needing to stage a home, interior designers, Â individual collectors / buyers, and corporate donors. The pieces can also be purchased online through a website and mobile app. Patronâs can be encouraged to gift subscriptions and commission pieces.What problem does this model solve ? Generally, everyone enjoys art. For the most part...everyone loves to have it around, they go to where it is being displayed, but they rarely , in a public setting, commit to the purchasing it. This model would help mitigate the perceived risks of the purchase, and it would keep artist in the area producing new work, and most importantly...sustaining their careers.A portion of the space can be transformed into artists lofts, and then rented by by the artist for a very a small monthly or weekly fee. .A portion of the money collected can be allotted for the wholesale purchase of materials, and then re-sold to the artist in the gallery at just above costs. It shouldnât be any problem enticing 1000 people out of a city of 1,000,000, to subscribe to this cause. This would generate $25,000 in guaranteed revenue per month. Communities need artist, and artist need money to survive. This model could be replicated in cities all over the country.Broadway Rendition of Where the Wild Things AreTourdini - A big data platform for touring musicians that would use anonymous data gathered from streaming music services, box office ticket numbers from venues, and merchandise sales numbers to predict tour revenue and merchandise sales.

The funny thing is that when I drink more water, I don\'t feel terrible. Huh? Weird.</p><p>Having a water bottle around helps me consistently remember to stay hydrated. It has really helped with my efforts to stay active on a daily basis. Drinking water throughout the day just feels right, and I think that the cold water is really what draws me to it. I really like knowing how many ounces of fluids I\'m consuming every day.</p><h2>Thing #2</h2><p><strong>It\'s sexy.</strong></p><p>In a way the bottle is a fashion statement. I\'ve decked it out with stickers from places that I care about, and it\'s yet another way to express myself. The stainless steel, and powder coating make it an elegant addition to yourÂ <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC\" target=\"_blank\">daily carry</a>Â gear. The metal is extremely shiny, which is awesome because I like shiny things. TheÂ rubberÂ seal fits on perfectly and lets out a reassuring \"Squeeeek\" to let me know that it is on tight enough. The plastic that makes up the lid and lid holder feel sturdy and are made from high-quality BPA-free plastic. It has a small rubber grip around the circumference of the lid which ensures I can open it even after the Incredible Hulk gets his hands on it.Â </p><h2>Thing #3</h2><p><strong>Do you want cold water? Because this is how you get cold water.</strong></p><p>I didn\'t always like cold water. In fact, there is a vast amount of research that suggests that human beings are better off drinking room temp or even warm water. Now I love cold water, and there isn\'t anything more satisfying in the summer heat, as taking a delicious swig from a nice cold water bottle. This bottle is insane. I\'ve left it in the car where it has gotten so hot I can hardly touch it, and the water inside is still cool. For hot drinks I kept tea in it, and was able to have hot tea throughout the day. I\'m also looking forward to snowboard season when I don\'t have to worry about my water bottle freezing like it has in the past.Â </p><p>Â </p><h2>1 month verdict: I love it</h2><p>So far so good. I have yet to find anything I don\'t like about it, and I should find something before too long. If you are someone who is in the market for a water bottle, this is for you. If you are someone who wishes their Nalgene kept things cool, shell out 34 bucks and give it a go.</p><p>Â </p><p>You can get them at your local <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/\">REI </a>store or head over to their <a href=\"https://www.hydroflask.com/\">site</a>, and see all of their swag.</p><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6447-e1440560941334.jpg\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"slide-down\" /><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6449.jpg\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"slide-up\" /><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_6479-e1441079580426.jpg\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"slide-left\" />','The verdict on my latest gear - The Hydro Flask','','publish','closed','open','','the-verdict-on-my-latest-gear-the-hydro-flask','','','2015-09-01 05:00:40','2015-09-01 05:00:40','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=428',0,'post','',0),(443,2,'2015-09-04 05:00:42','2015-09-04 05:00:42','&nbsp;<h1><strong>Â Do you love the new logo? Do you hate it?</strong></h1><p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8juvvEzwdo\">Tuesday morning</a> of this week everyone in the world had a funny looking play button on the google icon when they used it.Â </p><p>I myself was one of these people. Even though I only click on about 5% of all of the doodles that Google has to offer, I was intrigued by the big blue Play button and had to find out what it all meant. After clicking it and learning that it was their way of announcing a new logo, I thought: \"Hmm, I don\'t like it\". To me it just ruined the classic flair that Google. Their old logo was timeless, and even though it went through changes over the year, it was not nearly as grand as this one. Switching to a completely different style of font just seemed wrong and I didn\'t think it looked like Google.Â </p><p>As I was thinking about it, it dawned on me.Â </p><h2><strong>Google is a change company.</strong></h2><p>Sure they are a search engine company too, but the reason people work at Google has way more to do with the idea that a person can be \"Googly\". The dramatic change in the logo is a reminder of the dramatic changes they make in the world every day.</p><p>It also reminds me that like most species in the planet, I\'m averse to changes in my environment. The fact that my first response is to figure out what is wrong with it is an incredible reminder that change is happening around us all of the time. While it isn\'t helpful to jump on board with every change that\'s happening, I believe that it is important to spend time considering the possibility that the changes you\'ve been writing off are the same changes that could change your life.</p><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/First-google-logo.gif\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"fade\" /><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/largeNewGoogleLogoFinalFlat-a.png\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"fade\" /><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Logo_Google_2013_Official.svg_.png\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"fade\" /><img src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\" style=\"visibility:hidden\" data-animation=\"fade\" />','Why I love Google\'s new logo (and why I didn\'t at first)','','publish','closed','open','','googles-logo','','','2015-09-04 05:00:42','2015-09-04 05:00:42','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=443',0,'post','',0),(454,2,'2015-09-11 10:00:53','2015-09-11 10:00:53','<p>[caption id=\"attachment_455\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28efabf02ea881d89514f659c29d27c0.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-455 size-medium\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/28efabf02ea881d89514f659c29d27c0-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"28efabf02ea881d89514f659c29d27c0\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> The Engineered Workspace.[/caption]</p>\n<p>As a kid, my mother used to constantly remind me to \"clean up my room\".</p>\n<p>I hadÂ two main methods for doing this:</p>\n<p>Method 1(My method): Push everything in the closet and make my room look clean due toÂ an absence of Â toys and clutter that Â had until that point covered the floor.</p>\n<p>Method 2(My mother\'s method): Take everything out of it\'s place, and spend time considering why I had placed it where i placed itÂ and whether or not I could move it to somewhere better, or lose it all together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Method 1 allows me to show that I cared enough to give my room a pat on the shoulder, and get it to a point where it looked clean.</p>\n<p>Method 2 allows me to challenge the systems at play in my room.

You can say something like \"Good Job\" or \"This is great!\"Â The problem with that kind of feedback is that it doesn\'t change anything. It doesn\'t improve anything. The same goes for the people who say: \"this sucks\" or \"I don\'t get it\". It serves no purpose. Start by asking why a certain decision was made.</p>\n<p>If someone asks you for feedback, challenge the ideas that they present and start a conversation with them about those ideas. If you challenge a component of the essay, building, web site, etc., one of two things will happen. The person receiving feedback will either have a great explanation for choices they made on that component and will defend it. The alternative is they will realize that whatever it is must be changed, and will change it.</p>\n<p>If the point of the constructive feedback is to build something better, do everyone (yourself included) a favor and start by challenging everything. Too many projects have failed because they left the gate saturated with the words of those who simply agree with the idea and move forward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stop wasting time.</p>\n<p>Start challenging the smaller details.</p>\n<h2>Ship something throughÂ challenges madeÂ by real people.</h2>\n','Are you really offering \"constructive\" feedback?','','publish','closed','open','','feedback','','','2015-09-11 10:00:53','2015-09-11 10:00:53','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=454',0,'post','',0),(464,2,'2015-09-18 11:00:54','2015-09-18 11:00:54','<h2>I\'ve been an on again off again morning person for a while now.

When you come up with a solid reason for why you are waking up, you can start to build a morning habit that actually works for you.\n\n<strong>The reason to try this:</strong> I need to invest in myself before my day begins. In this way I can elevate my mood and am better equipped for whatever the day has to throw at me.\n\n<strong>TheÂ basic ritual:</strong> Wake up at least 2 hours before my first appointment of the day. Go to sleep in order to allow myself 7 hours of sleep every night.\n\nThe most crucial part to my success with this so far has been the night time ritual. Do yourself a favor and set a bed time, and isolate yourself from screens and people at a specific time. It\'s way easier to be intentional at the end of the day, so set yourself up for success.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Here are three things to keep in mind if you\'re like me and want to see your days become more positive.</h2>\nThing 1\n<h3>It\'s a fight against the body\'s feeling.</h3>\nYour body will tell you that you need to spend those hours sleeping because it isn\'t what you are used to. If our physical feelings when we wake up are mostly determined byÂ chemicals in our body we must recognize that we are not fighting to get out of bed, we are fighting the chemicals that want us to stay down.\n\nThing 2\n<h3>The value of waking up isn\'t in the number on your alarm clock.</h3>\nThe value is in the lifestyle you create for yourself. The name of the morning game is \"positivity\". The value of your morning is up to you. The more enriching moments you create for yourself in the morning, the more \"valuable\" your morning can be. So be intentional and make a note the night before of the things that have the ability to make you feel happy.\n\nThing3\n<h3>Accountability is a must.</h3>\nFind someone or something that will be waiting for you. Periscope has been an awesome way to have people waiting to see me wake up, even if they are just random people checking in. Â I\'ve also had a few weeks go by when someone I knew liked the idea and wanted me to text them to wake up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\'m on a journey to make it a <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/motivation/need-stop-bad-habit-need-66-days/784244/\">habit</a>. It will take me 66 days to form this habit. I look forward to sharing more about the process as I learn it.','Three things I\'ve learned about the art of rising early','','publish','closed','open','','mornings','','','2015-09-18 11:00:54','2015-09-18 11:00:54','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=464',0,'post','',0),(477,2,'2015-09-25 11:00:05','2015-09-25 11:00:05','<h3>I\'m sure you\'ve experienced a similar frustrating scenario before:</h3>\n<div></div>\n<div>You\'re running late. You do one last check before leaving and notice that you are missing your keys. You run around your house frantically looking \"everywhere\" for a while.

At this moment when I experience this the phrase: \"Insanity is defined as doing the same action twice and expecting a different result\". The keys you are looking for are always in the place you look at for the first time.</div>\n&nbsp;\n<div><strong>It\'s such a simple realization in the moment.</strong> I have to wonder how many of us get up in the morning, go and live our days and then wonder why we aren\'t living the super satisfying lives we always dream about.

My poor parents had to stay focused on avoiding all of the insane cross-country drivers and traffic from most people\'s nightmares. Meanwhile my brother, sister and I entertained each otherÂ by converting the back seat of our green Plymouth Voyager into a UFC fighting ring. It was never easy for my parents on tripsÂ and it made me feel like there was no way of traveling without stress. This isn\'t a post about traveling anywhere you want in the world with young kids. Even though I\'m not a parent, I\'d imagine that there would be a challenge to that no matter what \"life hack\" you have working for you. This is post about getting over a few hurdles that are holding people back from doing, creating, and discovering new and incredible weekends, and adding 2,496 hours of vacation time to your year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"I feel like going on a road trip but I don\'t know when we would go or where\" My friend Robby said over a basket of boneless garlic parmesan wings. \"What if we went to Mount Rushmore? It\'s only 6 hours away from Denver, and a friend of mine tells me it\'s a pretty cool road trip.\"\n\nNone of us had any vacation time, and since it was already October we were running out of opportunities for snow-free driving. If we wanted to do it that year we were going to need to get on it, and make it happen.\n\n\"What if we went this weekend?\" I said half-jokingly.\n\nThat\'s all it took.\n\nWe left Saturday Morning and got back Sunday night. I got to see Mount Rushmore, and the (still uncompleted) Crazy Horse monument all over a short period of time that would have normallyÂ consisted of me binge watching Netflix in my underwear.\n\nSince then I\'ve never been afraid to saying yes to the idea of a two-day adventure, and no to all of the things I would normally do over a weekend. This year we did a trip to the Grand Canyon from Colorado Springs Colorado.\n\n2 day weekend + 24 hours of driving + awesome landmarks + friends + snacks = an experience I\'m glad I was willing to go after.\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_001-e1447993796388.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-503 size-medium\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_001-e1447993796388-256x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Good morning\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\nI emerged on the other side of this journey with some great pictures, a few stories, and a few little bits that I will chew on the next time I evaluate whether or not to do something like similarÂ in the future.

For most people, itâs un-thinkable to donate the few days you have free from commitments to creating an experience that will last your lifetime. You may not be able to change the things you are committed to during your work week, but you do have the ability to change your thought process about what you can accomplish over a two day break.\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_006.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-494 size-medium\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_006-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"Overlooking the Grand Canyon\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>With this new level of thinking I look at my weekends in a whole new light.

Now design a weekend that is completely different from the average of your 5 past weekends. In this way you can come away from the weekend with a new outlook on life, and greet your Monday morning with stories about a weekend you dared to create.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Here are 5 simple rules to follow to createÂ memorable weekendÂ experiences:</strong></h2>\n<strong>Pick a destination -Â </strong>Choose a place that\'s outside of your comfort zone. a place that takes twice as long to get to as the usual place you might visit over a weekend.\n\n<strong>Go with friends-Â </strong>Find a few people you love spending time with who will go with you on this incredible journey. Make sure that these are people you get along with well. If you get 4 people together and are willing to share, the cost of a hotel room becomes a whole lot less.\n\n<strong>Don\'t plan too much-Â </strong>Stuff happens, and there isn\'t anything we can do about most of it. During a trip like this you must be willing to not take things to seriously and do your absolute best to focus your energy on only that which you can actually control.\n\n<strong>Be prepared to not sleep-Â </strong>Sleep as much as you can leading up to the trip, but recognize that in order to add some hours to your life you have to be willing to trade some of your time. You may not need to do this for closer locations, but anything over 8 hours away starts to wear on you. ( Having friends with you also helps here because they can take on some of the driving.)\n\n<strong>Pretend like you are leaving the day before you actually are - </strong>This seems really obvious but it\'s amazing how much better my adventures go if I pretend like I\'m leaving the day before. Having a list helps with packing, but it\'s nice to not have the weight of hurrying to get ready to leave. No one wants to be the person that holds up the group.\n\n<strong>Bonus! See the beauty in everything -</strong> Focus on the beauty all around you. You may not live where there are lots of pretty things to visit fairly close by, but I\'m sure there is somewhere that is different from what you are used to. Go find that place and look for the beauty that exists there. I know you can do it!\n\n<img style=\"visibility: hidden;\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_005-e1447993610731.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-animation=\"fade\" /><img style=\"visibility: hidden;\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_001-e1447993419568.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-animation=\"fade\" />','Unlock 2,496 vacation hours.','','draft','closed','open','','','','','2015-11-20 04:36:11','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=490',0,'post','',0),(507,2,'2015-11-20 12:00:48','2015-11-20 12:00:48','&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_0051.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-514\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_0051.jpeg\" alt=\"File_005\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /></a>\n\n(tips are at the bottom)\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Iâve always had this idea that vacations have to be difficult.</strong></h2>\nGrowing up, my family always got really stressed out whenever we had to driveÂ somewhere.

In this way you can come away from the weekend with a new outlook on life, and greet your Monday morning with stories about a weekend you dared to create.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Here are 5 simple rules to follow to createÂ memorable weekendÂ experiences:</strong></h2>\n<strong>Pick a destination -Â </strong>Choose a place that\'s outside of your comfort zone. a place that takes twice as long to get to as the usual place you might visit over a weekend.\n\n<strong>Go with friends-Â </strong>Find a few people you love spending time with who will go with you on this incredible journey. Make sure that these are people you get along with well. If you get 4 people together and are willing to share, the cost of a hotel room becomes a whole lot less.\n\n<strong>Don\'t plan too much-Â </strong>Stuff happens, and there isn\'t anything we can do about most of it. During a trip like this you must be willing to not take things to seriously and do your absolute best to focus your energy on only that which you can actually control.\n\n<strong>Be prepared to not sleep-Â </strong>Sleep as much as you can leading up to the trip, but recognize that in order to add some hours to your life you have to be willing to trade some of your time. You may not need to do this for closer locations, but anything over 8 hours away starts to wear on you. ( Having friends with you also helps here because they can take on some of the driving.)\n\n<strong>Pretend like you are leaving the day before you actually are - </strong>This seems really obvious but it\'s amazing how much better my adventures go if I pretend like I\'m leaving the day before. Having a list helps with packing, but it\'s nice to not have the weight of hurrying to get ready to leave. No one wants to be the person that holds up the group.\n\n<strong>Bonus! See the beauty in everything -</strong> Focus on the beauty all around you. You may not live where there are lots of pretty things to visit fairly close by, but I\'m sure there is somewhere that is different from what you are used to. Go find that place and look for the beauty that exists there. I know you can do it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_008.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-500\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_008.jpeg\" alt=\"Grand Canyon overlook\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\" /></a>\n\n<img style=\"visibility: hidden;\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_005-e1447993610731.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-animation=\"fade\" /><img style=\"visibility: hidden;\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/File_001-e1447993419568.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-animation=\"fade\" />','Unlock 2,496 Vacation Hours.','','publish','closed','open','','2496vacation','','','2015-11-20 12:00:48','2015-11-20 12:00:48','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=507',0,'post','',0),(550,2,'2016-08-26 23:09:40','2016-08-26 23:09:40','<h2></h2>\n<h2>Here\'s a quick update on my life since my last post.</h2>\n<ul>\n 	<li>Quit my job and started a <a href=\"http://ghettifish.com\">company</a>.</li>\n 	<li>Got married to the love of my life.</li>\n 	<li>Moved 3,000 miles away to Alaska.</li>\n</ul>\nDuring all of this I\'ve been feeling my life running away from me, like I never have enough time and I\'m not living a life I can be proud of. I\'m 100% positive that I\'m not the first person to try this and definitely not the first person to make this observation:\n<h1>Media is killing me.</h1>\nI only have so many hours in my life. Media is eating those hours away like a corrosive acid robbing me of experiences, and taking me away from other people in my life.\n\nI work on a computer so distraction in one form or another is imminent. The most pernicious of all forms of media is inspirational media. These are videos, images and posts all aiming to help us improve our lives. I have spent hours if not days watching these types of videos. I go through them like crack cocaine seeking the next video fix to help me feel like I\'m making a positive change in my life.\n<h2>These videos suck me in.</h2>\nOnce I watch one video, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. they all know how to keep me hooked with videos that I will want to watch appearing right in front of me. Â The challenging thing for me is that I actually work on these platforms creating media for companies and getting helpful info out to their audiences. I\'m coming to a new conclusion about all of the videos that I spend my time on. There is nothing out there that will help me achieve a better life full of rich experiences. I don\'t care who the speaker is or what the message is. I am making a new oath to be a creator/contributor not a consumer/viewer.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>For the next 31 days I am committingÂ to not watching videos, not looking at Facebook images, not watching movies.</h2>\nFor some people these platforms are great and they are able to use them in moderation. That is not the case for me. I\'ve lied to myself about why I haven\'t been doing very well financially, blaming it on the amount of work needed to get ready for my move and my wedding. Well now here I am in Alaska and I\'m realizing that I am and have been the problem all along.\n\nI\'d like to use this month to create for people, write posts, make videos, and actually get work done.\n\nAs I move through this process I will take as many notes as I can to track and see how much of a difference this really has on my life. This is in order to take back my life, and do things that matter.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>My manifesto:</h2>\nFrom today August 26th until November 1st I\'m reclaiming my life, reaching for my goals, and striving to help those in need around me by eliminating toxins from my day to day activities. I will remove and refuse to absorb anything from the following sites and activities:\n<ul>\n 	<li><strong>YouTube</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Twitter</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Facebook</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Instagram</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Snapchat</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Reddit</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Video Games (Including Phone apps)</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Podcasts</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Movies</strong></li>\n 	<li><strong>Television Shows</strong></li>\n</ul>\nMy life is too valuable to spend on these sites unless I\'m actually doing the hard part in making a real contribution. I\'m grounding myself to stay away from all of these platforms with the exception of making posts for work using third party apps to publish content.\n\nSigned - Nic Bovee\n\n[embed]https://youtu.be/Q2M5l16z2iA[/embed]','Consumption to Contribution','','publish','closed','open','','consumption-to-contribution','','','2016-08-26 23:09:40','2016-08-26 23:09:40','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=550',0,'post','',0),(556,2,'2016-08-27 23:14:14','2016-08-27 23:14:14','First day out and I\'m not good at this.

Grooves help the musician make decisions without having to think too much.\n<h3><strong>FourÂ things that get meÂ intoÂ my \"groove\":</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n 	<li><strong>No Media. -Â </strong>This hasn\'t been something I\'ve always been specifically conscious of. I recently hadÂ the realization that I\'m a <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3055149/what-i-learned-in-12-weeks-of-therapy-for-social-media-addiction\">media addict</a>. Eliminating media and primarily shifting my mentality from \"consumer\" to \"contributor\" has given me a very black and white code to live by.\n\n<hr />\n\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Consistent Delivery-Â </strong>I found small things to deliver on in the morning. For myself it\'s getting a brief work out in. Since I\'ve been married, I have found that making breakfast and lunch before taking her to work is also something that I can be consistent on. It sets the tone for my day and pulls me into \"my groove\".\n\n<hr />\n\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Timing-Â </strong>I have a monkey brain and find it hard to concentrate sometimes. When I set a time for myself I\'m creating an estimate for how long I think something will take. With the time ticking down it\'s hard to get off track. I\'m a big believer in using time rather than spending it.\n\n<hr />\n\n</li>\n 	<li><strong>Recording-Â </strong>Time just like money should be tracked and managed in order to effectively harness the power that comes with it. That\'s why I record my time to look back and see what I did. No one likes to look back on a day and say: \"Where did my day go?\" No one likes to look at their bank account and say \"I wonder what I spent it all on?\"\n\n<hr />\n\n</li>\n</ol>\nIt\'s not a perfect groove by any means but these are very small things I\'ve noticed over the year when I\'ve been operating at peak performance.\n<h3>My groove</h3>\nIt\'s day 6 of my \"Month Minus Media\" and I finally feel like I\'m getting used to ignoring it. I\'ve been very close to hopping on YouTube, or checking Facebook, but so far I\'m staying strong.\n\nThis morning for the first time I pulledÂ myself out of bed at a time I amÂ relatively proud of: 6am. It gave me enough time to get a quick workout in and make a good breakfast for my wife and I.\n\nAs a result, I\'m feeling amped today and excited to tackle my first project of the day: Goals for September.\n\nGetting in the groove is easier when you aren\'t watching everyone else\'s grooves.\n\nPerhaps tomorrow my groove will wakeÂ me up even earlier.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://nicbovee.com/groove/ghettifish-inc-psst-03/#main\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-572\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-572 size-medium\" src=\"http://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ghettifish-inc.-psst-03-300x184.png\" alt=\"Ghettifish inc. psst-03\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /></a>','Groove in life, and don\'t let it get \"thrown off\"','','publish','closed','open','','groove','','','2016-09-01 18:02:55','2016-09-01 18:02:55','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=566',0,'post','',0),(575,2,'2016-09-02 18:33:49','2016-09-02 18:33:49','<h1 style=\"text-align: left; color: #ff6c4c;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #ff6c4c;\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams\">\"Weniger, aber besser\"</a></strong></h1>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">-Dieter Rams</h1>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">In english: <strong>\"Less, but better\"</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Build small,Â then refine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\"Not enough\" is a state of mind</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">fabricated by those who sell \"more\".</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>\"Not enough time\",Â </strong></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: right;\">becomes:</h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>\"Better, in less time\".</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;','Why I need to subtract','','publish','closed','open','','subtract','','','2016-09-02 18:33:49','2016-09-02 18:33:49','',0,'http://nicbovee.com/?p=575',0,'post','',0),(592,2,'2016-09-09 13:52:50','2016-09-09 13:52:50','<h2><strong>Moving to a new place is weird.

Being liked is the other half. And if you are not well-liked, youâll lose opportunity to those who, technically, are inferior to you. Donât let this happen. Zig talks to us today about the value of being liked, and literally gives us â10 Commandments of Human Relations!â Thanks to Salesforce for supporting this episode.\n\nHey, everyone, this is Kevin Miller, your host of The Ziglar Show. Today, Zig hits us hard on the necessity of relationships. You know the old clichÃ©â, itâs not what you know, but who you know? Well, todayâs message is different. Itâs not just knowing people, butâ¦do they like you? The two points of todayâs show is 1) how handicapped you are, even if youâre the best at what you do, and 2) if you think you have room to improve on the âlikeâ scale. Zig literally gives 10 points on how to increase this.\n<h2>Thanks for the reviews!</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\nReally quick, before we dive in with Zig today, I want to thank you so much for subscribing to the show and forwarding it on for others to subscribe. Youâve been sharing the show on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere; youâve been leaving great reviews in iTunes and Stitcher, and it led to us being the #10 podcast in iTunesâ¦overall. On the planet. Take your biggest celebrity who is at the top of their game today, who has a podcast, and The Ziglar Show was ahead of all but nine. You know what that says? People are hungry for this message of hope and inspiration and TRUEâ¦Performance.\n\nAnd, by the way, thanks to so many recent iTunes reviews that specifically give thanks to Zigâs son, Tom Ziglar, and me, who host these shows and bring our own voices to the table. There are negative reviews once in a while from a few people who have said they just want Zig, not anything else. For those folks, Iâd encourage you to go buy Zigâs materials at <a href=\"http://Ziglar.com\">Ziglar.com</a>. Weâd be thrilled to have you do that. This podcast, however, is here to bring you Zig, but as a priority, to bring you the best of todayâs voices in inspiration and motivation and personal development and true performance! Which includes our guests, Tom Ziglar, and yours truly. I run this show, and was brought on by the Ziglar family to speak my own flavor of inspiration, which I proudly accepted\n\n</div>\n<h2></h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Breakdown:</h2>\n<div>\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n<div>Many of the primary desires we have of life, to be prosperous, to be happyâ¦are dependent on our daily work. I donât know anyone who is truly joyful, successful, and who people respect and are attracted to, who does not also find fulfillment at work.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\nBut next, Zig states that a, if not the, primary root that influences whether our job is good, is the relationships with the people we have there.\n\nHaving, progressing in, and keeping the job we have depends on the relationships we have at work. People hire you and pay you, in part, of course, because of your competency, productivity, and results. But also because theyâ¦like you. I wanted to add âtrust you,â but then didnât. I think itâs important that Zig used to say, âbecause they LIKE you.â Iâve know people I trusted but didnât like, and I wouldnât hire or retain them. Iâve known people who were the best at their job, skill, and profession, but I didnât hire them because I didnât really like them.\n\nThere is too much competition out there in the marketplace to think you have to deal with someone you donât like. And there are too many opportunities out there to take a job with people you donât like.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Why did they get the job and not YOU?</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\nNow, letâs take this time to discuss the issue of frustration, for those of you who have been passed up by those you believe are not as skilled as you, and not as trustworthy as you. And youâre disappointed, if not plain mad, that those charlatans are succeeding.\n\nFolks, Iâm sorry. In a way, itâs a shame, but itâs also humanity. It is a game, to a point. And if you donât play it, you are handicapping yourself. Over a decade ago, I had a role as marketing consultant to a large bicycle parts manufacturer. The owner and founder is an incredible inventor. Truly incredible. And, at heart, a well-meaning guy, I believe. But he, I think heâd claim he was a purist. He was in it for the art and inventing and making a better product. He wasnât in it for money or to play games. But he was routinely beaten out by lesser companies or products. And it made him mad. So much so that he had a chip on his shoulder about marketing. And he kept it hamstrung, which was a shame! He had a great story we could have used to make the brand #1; I really believe that. But he was mad at the game. He is, and forever will be, one of the best, but never the best.\n\nAgain, what a shame! Donât let that be your story. Be excellent. Be trustworthy. But also, be likeable! It will give you so much more opportunity to provide your skill!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>It pays to be \"likeable\"</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\nOn another side, Iâve recently fired two employees who, in truth, had more experience, know-how, and expertise in their jobs than the people I hired in their places. But I hired people I liked much more, and that our customers like better. And, in a short time, weâve gotten them training and experience and they are soon outpacing the previous employees. Everybody is happier! Itâs a great workplace to come to, we encourage and inspire and lift each other up! Weâre attracting more business, making more money, and creating excellence! You just canât argue with or deny it.\n\nSo, to be likable, to have solid relationshipsâ¦\n\nZig gives us 10 commandments of human relations. And, folks, this was the first time I heard this list from Zig. I greatly appreciate him saying âthis isnât new stuff.â Nothing new. But as you listen, I guarantee that you, like I, will hear some profound truths.\n\n</div>\n<h2>Here they are:</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n 	<li>Speak to people</li>\n 	<li>Smile at people</li>\n 	<li>Call people by name</li>\n 	<li>Be friendly and helpful to people</li>\n 	<li>Be cordial, speak and act as if everything you do is a pleasure</li>\n 	<li>Be genuinely interested in other people</li>\n 	<li>Be generous with your praise and be very careful with any criticism you might give</li>\n 	<li>Be considerate of the feelings of others</li>\n 	<li>Be alert to give service; what counts most in life is what we do for others</li>\n 	<li>Add to this a good sense of humor</li>\n</ol>\nRewind and listen to those again. Weâll end this show by listing those again, and just making a little mention with each to help ensure you really understand them.\n\nZig says,\n<blockquote>\"<em>The best thing to do behind a personâs back is to pat it.\"</em></blockquote>\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Venting andÂ Criticism</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div>\n\nI must admit I struggle here some. I often find myself dealing with someone who isâ¦very needy. Very. And not very cognizant of anyone else. After being with them, my very soul longs to vent and find comfort from a rational person. But venting that criticism does not bring life to anyone! Not the person whose back I am talking behind. Not me. And not my friend who I am venting to! Have you ever had someone vent criticism to you and it left you feeling inspired? Lifted? Encouraged?\n\nNow, you may needâ¦to vent. But at least know the score. At least know you are placing yourself in a place of need at the expense of others.\n\nZig says people want to be\n<ul>\n 	<li>Right</li>\n 	<li>Appreciated</li>\n 	<li>Understood</li>\n</ul>\nBut, folks, whatâs important here is that of course heâs speaking also about himself. And you and me. We want those things. But if we want to be liked, we have to have at least SOME times of not being the needy recipient, but being the giver, and shelving our own needs.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>What\'s YOUR stance?</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div>\n\nWatch yourself when you are with others and try to recognize the stance you take. Some people you will be more prone to give to. With some you will put yourself in a place of need. You can go into any group of people and listen for a moment, and discern those who are there who NEED from the group, and those that are secure and are willing to shelve their needs and give. Of course, youâve got some in the mix who are neither, they are too insecure to engage, or too uncaring. But look for the first twoâ¦the needy and the giving.\n\nNext, Zig goes into a good amount of story and analogy to prove we allâ¦react primarily emotionally, not logically.\n\nSo, if we want to be liked, which improves our own success, we are dealing in an emotional realm! Which means when we are upset that weâre not liked, we think about how we:\n<ul>\n 	<li>Show up for work early</li>\n 	<li>Stay late</li>\n 	<li>Do our job-related tasks perfectly</li>\n 	<li>Do the work to tidy up othersâ shoddy jobs</li>\n 	<li>Never steal from the company, not time or materials</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why you buy the products you buy:</h2>\n\n<hr />\n\nI feel for you. I really do. But folks, there are products you purchase that are not proven the best. They are not proven the most reliable or cutting-edge or most innovative or longest-lasting. But you buy them because youâ¦like them. Or you buy some products and specifically NOT others, because you donât like them.\n\nIf you are doing all those things I just mentioned, being exemplary in your work, but you are NOT doing Zigâs list of ten things, you are missing it! And I understand you! I wish I could just earn my way into Heaven by doing the right things. It doesnât work that way! The biggest commandment is to love others. Which, ultimately, is exactly what Zig is talking about here:\n<h2>Letâs read the list again and make sure we understand these principles:</h2>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Speak to people -</h2>\nSimple enough, but how often do we not? Just recognize their presence! Donât be fake or false, but there is a live, human being in your midst. Just say âHello!â âGood morning!â Donât say, âHow yaâ doinâ?â unless you are really asking. When you walk into work, be prepared. I donât care if youâre an introvert like I am! I donât care if itâs sometimes uncomfortable, I understand! Do it anyway. Itâs for YOUR own good, as well as theirs. If at home by yourself you walk around in your underwear or PJs, donât shave or shower sometimes, yet you shower and put pants on for work, put this in the same category. You wear pants, and you speak to people in your presence.</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Smile at people â</h2>\nFolks, this is a lost art, yet worth its weight in gold. Would you hold the door open for a hobbling old lady carrying groceries behind you in the grocery store? Surely you would. It doesnât mean you know her, like her, or will be given a trophy by anyone. Think of smiling the same way. Everyone needs and deserves a smile. And, in giving it, you earn reciprocity and your life will only become easier and better.</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Call people by name â</h2>\nyou can claim youâre bad with names and suffer if you want. Iâm bad with math, but Iâm going to learn enough to not be a reprobate in society. Ask and remember names. When 60 seconds goes by and you realize you forgot, say, âIâm sorry, tell me your name again?â Itâs ok, they forgot yours, too. In my work, I never leave my office without a pen and pad of sticky notes with the personâs name Iâm leaving to meet, or I have it there to write their name down when I ask it.</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be friendly and helpful to people â</h2>\nNot sure what I can add to thatâ¦</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be cordial, speak and act as if everything you do is a pleasure â</h2>\nA pleasure!! Weâre in a culture of saying thanks and being responded to with âNo problem.â Which means, by proxy, serving you COULD have been a problem. Donât do that. Respond with âMy pleasure!â âMy honor!â âAbsolutely!â I have many customers and clients who emphatically thank me as Iâm doing them huge favors. Folks, they are paying me and my businesses. Paying a lot! Itâs my JOB to serve them. But if you do it in a truly honoring and serving way, with great gratitude for their business, theyâll thank you like you were volunteering to help them!</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be genuinely interested in other people â</h2>\nMy oldest daughter struggles with this. She has problems within a given circumstance, she knows she is NOT genuinely interested in those she is with or around, and feels itâs false to pretend. Soâ¦should you fake it? Is that wrong in being disingenuous? Godâs greatest commandment is to love others, right? That is not a feeling. I love my wife and kids with true feeling and commitment. I donât love ANYONE else that way. But I can love others by making the effort to care. To recognize. To serve them in the moment, ahead of myself.</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be generous with your praise and be very careful with any criticism you might give â</h2>\nHow many times were you praisedâ¦today? In this past week? And how much did you praise others? Not including your kids. If you are around others, you have the chance to be generous with your praise. The grocery bagger at the grocery store who is simply doing the job they are paid to doâ¦that your money to buy groceries pays forâ¦is worthy of praise. They stood there and bagged your groceries. I often feel guilty, especially when itâs someone I know Iâm physically far more capable than. I feel almost arrogant to stand there and let them bag MY food. So, why not say, âThank you SO much!â</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be considerate of the feelings of others â</h2>\nNot cognizant of, but actually give consideration. This may be the hardest, but as with all of these, itâs just an action and habit. Not to polarize or dismiss or condemn. Often, it wonât matter. You have nothing invested in how they feel, it wonât matter to your life. So why not just say, âOh, wow, that makes sense.â âI can understand that.â âIâm so sorry!â</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Be alert to give service. What counts most in life is what we do for others â</h2>\nLooking for opportunities to help.</li>\n 	<li>\n<h2>Finally,add to this a good sense of humor.</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\nThanks for reading the post remember you can leave a review of the show on <a href=\"http://zigshow.com/itunes\">iTunes</a> or <a href=\"http://zigshow.com/stitcher\">Stitcher</a>.

I absolutely cannot afford to give myself the 1-2 hours I usually take to write the blog and ship the blog. Because of this I\'ve decided to create a time constraint and a subject constraint to help me communicate as much as possible with as little text as needed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday\'s blog is brought to you by my good friend Todd Anderson who (without realizing it) reminded me that people out there care and want to know how we are doing with the newly married life, Alaska living, and all of the other crazinessÂ that comes with life transitions. He asked a few questions that I feel necessitated a proper response. There are so many people out there who have supported both of us through this transition and soÂ I feel like I owe it to everyone to give you somewhat of an update. I\'m giving myself 30-mins. to write it. Â Here we go:\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https://nicbovee.com/questions-someone-moved-alaska/img_4435/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-688\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-688\" src=\"https://nicbovee.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_4435.jpg\" alt=\"img_4435\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /></a></strong></h2>\n<h2><strong>How are you?</strong></h2>\nThis is a question I get asked almost every single day, and I think the \"canned messages\" center of my brain is probably tired of handing out the typical \"I\'m fine\" or \"I\'m great\" responses. My honest to goodness answer when I consider all of the aspects that matter in my life is that it just depends on the day of the week. Dani and I have adjusted well to married life (although I know there\'s work on my end to be the man that she needs). Because I\'m a new business owner, my mind puts me in a valley in between the: \"I\'m going nowhere with my life and should probably just work at Starbucks for the rest of my life\" and \"This is scary but I can really make something of this business if I really go for it.\" I think stress bleeds through from this aspect of everything into the rest of my life. Overall things are peachy and I couldn\'t be happier to be living with Dani in such a beautiful and dark place of the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>How\'s work?</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nEver since March, I have been pushing harder than ever to build my business into this \"dream job\" I had envisioned when I started the thing off. It\'s been 9 months now and I feel like I\'m at the place I wanted to be in two weeks when I started. It\'s been a personal journey more than anything else and it has been anything but a stable typical job. It\'s the \"starving artist\" lifestyle with the freedom, experiences, pain, and joy that come along for the ride.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Community?</strong></h2>\nThe community in Anchorage is cool. I think something I noticed early on that I really appreciate is that it blends a city with the wildness that occupies the outlying territory. There are ton\'s of college kids all super focused on their studies, and at the same time you have people who are working their butts off to come up with something that will stabilize the economy now that the oil industry is not as great for AK as it used to be. Dani and I are apart of the Alaska Chamber Singers which has given us a really cool view inside of some lives that have been here for over 50 years. It\'s really amazing to hear some of the history told from someone else\'s perspective and then get to look around and imagine how different the territory was when they got here.\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Friends?</strong></h2>\nDani and I both were really nervous about this when we left. Moving 3000+ miles away from everyone you know, to a place where you only two people is something that neither of us could fully grasp. At first it was just us. On days when one of us would be at home alone we would both experience homesickness and constantly dwell on everything we left. It was out of desperation one Sunday morning that I went and visited a church that happens to be a block away from where we live. It was here that I met most of the people we have grown very close to in a short period of time. I was invited to workout with the group and I just feel like the Father has been answering prayers and needs within my heart left and right.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;','Questions for someone who moved to Alaska','','publish','closed','open','','questions-someone-moved-alaska','','','2016-12-15 06:50:22','2016-12-15 06:50:22','',0,'https://nicbovee.com/?p=685',0,'post','',0),(694,2,'2017-02-01 09:38:16','2017-02-01 09:38:16','<strong>I\'ve been up since 5.

It\'s an affordable mirrorlessÂ camera that shoots 4k. He got into the technical details, but I\'m not even going to try to discuss what advantages and disadvantages there are to the camera. I did learn a bit about the MFT (Micro Four-thirds) system, which is very intriguing and gave me some insight on the varying specs across the board.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Formats\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Sensor_sizes_overlaid_inside_-_updated.svg/600px-Sensor_sizes_overlaid_inside_-_updated.svg.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"491\" />\n<h2><strong>Tip 1: By used on Lens Authority.</strong></h2>\nI had never heard of them before, butÂ if you\'re looking for a way to buy a camera on the cheap and don\'t like eBay, this is a good place to go.\n<h2>Tip 2: Use a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G3NW5M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004G3NW5M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ghettifish-20&amp;linkId=9a6c0757e28c21b553f1229f27982090\">white balance card</a>Â and adjustable <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NH2RTZW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghettifish-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NH2RTZW&amp;linkId=1ebd55ae856f513d90e5f843c404dec4\">light panels</a>Â to get the right temperature for your shots.</h2>\nWhen I walked in the room, I felt like I was stepping onto a TV set, because I was. The bright LED panels made all of the difference and are one of the reasons television looks more professional. I always associated temperature with theÂ weather, but in film-making, it means a whole lot more. Understanding temperature and making the appropriate lighting adjustments is crucial for getting a professional look. The white balance card lets you adjust the lighting to be conducive for the best shot by showing you a perfect white vs a reflective white that picks up other colors.\n<h2>Tip 3: Check out<a href=\"http://main.philipbloom.net/\"> Philip Bloom</a></h2>\nHe\'s a great resource for learning about what gear to use, and how to become a better filmmaker.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese may be extremely basic tips, but for me, they were all new and very helpful as an <span style=\"background-color: #f3a8a3;\">inexperienced</span>Â filmmaker.','A professional cameraman\'s tips on choosing gear.','','publish','closed','open','','professional-cameramans-tips-choosing-gear','','','2017-02-03 17:19:46','2017-02-03 17:19:46','',0,'https://nicbovee.com/?p=716',0,'post','',0),(721,2,'2017-02-03 20:50:20','2017-02-03 20:50:20','I would definitely like to spend some more time getting the shadows to look better.
